Challenges in Dairy Industry 1. Asset loss : Loosing crates into the market cost $100 million (approx.)each year only to a dairy industry. https://www.dairyfoods.com/articles/91378-theft-of-milk-crates-is-a-100-million-annual-loss-to-the-dairy-industry 2. Time taking procedure to count the crates. - Normally, it takes 10-15 mins to count 150-200 crates. 3. Real-time data not maintained for crate movement, consumption. 4. Audit for crates inventory is a very tedious job and is mandatory to be done once or twice in a month. 5. Pilferages and mishandling of crates takes place in a dairy supply chain. 6. Entire process is manual. Our Solution: TrackSure TrackSure: End to End Solution for Crate Management Accurate, Intelligent, Mobile Assisted Realtime tracking of Crates across entire Dairy Supply Chain using Computer Vision and Machine Learning technology Completely digital crate management platform to provide traceability of crates Components of TrackSure 1. Hardware: Industrial camera, Sensor 2. Unique, non-removable tags for crates 3. Mobile Application 4. Web Portal 5. Online checkweigher (optional) TrackSure in Dairy Supply Chain Dairy Plant Packaging Cold Storage Transportation Retailer Reception Dock Industrial cameras and Empowering stakeholders from Smartphone camera checkweigher are deployed to dispatch dock to retail store and automatically scans the stack identify crates marked with back to dairy with TrackSure of empty crates – result of unique marker tags along with Mobile App for crate tracking which is synced with the product variant & weight TrackSure Mobile App Our Solution : TrackSure • Each crate is embedded with 13 mm non-removable, washable, unique tags of various shapes. • On all the four sides of the crate, 6 such shapes are embedded making a unique combination, which acts as unique ID for crate identification. Triangle Rec- Circle Square Dia- Semi- tangle circle mond • One lakh of such unique combinations are possible. • Two symbols in the first Row are identification for Dairy Plant • All the unique IDs of the crates will be stored in the system to validate the existence of the crate • Some crate counting solutions based on RFID and NFC are available in the market but they involve expensive sensing equipments. • Our unique tag for crate management leverages existing technology. Combination of marker tags on crates for unique • All the unique tags are needed to be integrated into the crate for just one time. crate ID Process/ How does it works • We have defined the unique ID for each & every crate • We have developed advanced computer vision algorithm which assist the following operation: • In Processing Plant: • Industrial camera captures images on conveyor through which crates are passing from packaging section to cold storage. • Based on the captured image, data of total number of crates and the product variant in the crate gets interlinked with the Crate ID and gets recorded. • Dynamic weight of crates can be interlinked with no. of product variant using online checkweigher. • At Dispatch & Reception Dock: • The user captures the image of crate stack of unique IDs using mobile application. • Based on the captured image, data of total number of crates for IN & OUT with vehicle and driver details gets recorded. Stage: Transit in Packaging Section • Two industrial cameras are fixed on crate conveyor to capture the images of each crates to be transferred to cold storage. • Camera will extract: • Product variant in crate by its color • Size of Product variant • Unique ID of the crate • Total number of crates • Timestamp • Interlocking will be provided to stop the conveyor if crates are been placed one over another. • Checkweigher is installed on the crate conveyor to monitor the weight of each crate (optional) This entire process is fully automated and digitized. Gives real-time update of stock (which and how much product variant) along with the crate details - transferred from packaging to cold storage. Stage: Transit in Packaging Section Crate unique ID based on shapes Size of material in crate is identified using advanced Product variant in the crate identified using advanced computer vision algorithm computer vision algorithm Stage: Transit in Packaging Section Working video of TrackSure at transit in packaging section Stage: Transit in Packaging Section Following information is recorded based on crate movement Report Generated from web portal.

Count Serial ID Color Variant 1 4GB7I Red Gold 2 F5II0 Red Gold • The data is authenticated with OTP on drivers mobile number. 3 F5IB0 Red Gold • Dispatch In-charge/ Supervisor captures images of stack of 10 crates. 4 B4G70 Red Gold 5 IG4B5 Red Gold 6 GJ74B Red Gold • The following data gets recorded 7 05FB7 Red Gold 8 FIG07 Green Shakti • Total number of crates 9 GIB07 Green Shakti • Unique ID of crates 10 0FIG5 Green Shakti • The system will integrate this information with the information stored at packaging level. (Material type, quantity, count of crates, crate ID) • Geo-location and time would be automatically get linked to the above record. This automated process helps recording in real-time, the actual dispatch of the material against the demand of the material. Stage: Retail Truck - Unload/ Load • After reaching at retail location, the truck driver uses Mobile App to capture images of stacks of crate unloaded from the truck. • He also captures image of stacks of empty crates being returned by retailer, to be loaded back in the truck. • The following data gets recorded • Total number of crates • Unique ID of crates • Geo-location and time would be automatically get linked to the above record. • Generates alerts if any crates are missing / mismatched/ misplaced based on Unique ID of crates. • Provides data of number of retailers in a particular geo-location can be known. • Consumption pattern/ demand of products in a particular geo-location can be known. Stage: Empty Crate Solution at Reception Dock TrackSure consists of black curtain frame, stand for smartphone, android smartphone and TrackSure mobile App, deployed at the reception dock where the vehicles bring back the empty crates from various retail points. • Black curtain and stand for smartphone is placed on the two opposite sides of the vehicle to enable smooth unloading of the empty crates. • The smartphone camera will continuously scan the stack of empty crates when the crates are being unloaded from the vehicle. Thus, there shall be no need to capture individual images of stack of crates, which will enable faster unloading of the crates. Following data is recorded: • Count of number of empty crates received back • Unique ID of crates • Which driver from which retail location brought back empty crates • Geo-location with timestamp Our system, TrackSure helps in providing complete overview of crate movement in entire dairy supply chain and generates alerts if any crates are missing based on unique ID of crates.
