1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 About Product Prompt MilkoLite Combo, is an indigenous milk testing machine that combines two essential requirements: stirring and analyzing milk parameters such as Fat, SNF, added water, and milk density. It is robust, easy to operate, and useful for analyzing cow, buffalo, and mixed milk. The MilkoLite Combo analyzes the raw milk and gets the substances details like FAT%, SNF%, ADDED WATER%, and DENSITY. Also able to provide PROTEIN, LACTOSE and SALT. Calibration of MilkoLite Combo can be done through Mobile Application as well as manual. Prompt’s MilkoLite Combo is highly efficacious that renders consistent performance over an extended period with maintaining accuracy and fully protected calibration. 1.2 Things to Remember During the Installation Process of MilkoLite Combo Keep the MilkoLite Combo machine in a clean and tidy place. MilkoLite Combo can be operated with 230 volt AC OR 12 volt DC. If the voltage of AC Supply is not stable (between 180 Volts to 260 Volts) then use stabilizer or UPS. Mineral water, RO water or Distilled water can be used to clean the MilkoLite Combo. Take 30ml to 35ml milk in sample bottle. In a MilkoLite Combo, filter the milk sample before testing the milk. The temperature of milk should be less than 40oC, if the temperature is more than 40oC then there will be error of “Error-2 HOT / NO SAMPLE” in the machine. Before analysis of milk sample in a MilkoLite Combo, Stir the milk and then analyze the milk so air bubbles will remove from the RAW milk. Stir the milk for 15 second if the temperature of milk is less than 15oC and Stir the milk for 10 second if the temperature of milk is greater than 15oC. Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw sample of milk from the farmer and analyze again. Clean the machine two or three times with clean water before starting milk collection and also with clean water three times after the milk collection is completed. After the collection is completed in each shift, prepare a mixture of Daily Cleaner 5% and Water 95% and clean MilkoLite Combo, then clean 15-20 times with the same solution using a plunger. After the every 15 days, prepare a mixture of Power/Monthly Cleaner 10% and Water 90% and clean MilkoLite Combo.
