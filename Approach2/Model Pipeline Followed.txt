1. Raw Data Files (pdf, word, ppt)

2. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Script 1: Document Preprocessing
Read and extract text data from the 170 Word and PDF files (manuals, brochures, PPTs).
For PDFs: Use libraries like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or fitz (PyMuPDF).
For Word documents: Use python-docx.
Preprocess the extracted text (cleaning, tokenization, language detection).
Split the documents into sections (based on headings or structure) for easier context retrieval.
Detect the language of each document or section


3. Embedding Generation and Storage

Tokenization:
Each document or section is tokenized using the appropriate model's tokenizer (e.g., AutoTokenizer for IndicBERT or mT5, or Sentence-Transformers tokenizer).
Tokenization ensures the text is transformed into token IDs or embeddings that the model can process.

Embeddings Creation:
IndicBERT: Uses the ai4bharat/IndicBERTv2-MLM-only model to generate embeddings. The [CLS] token embeddings are extracted from the last hidden state.
mT5: Uses the google/mt5-small model. Mean pooling is applied over the encoder's last hidden state to generate embeddings.
Sentence-Transformers: Uses the sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 model to create sentence-level embeddings.

Splitting Text:
Documents are split into smaller chunks (typically around 300 tokens) using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. This ensures that embeddings can be generated for manageable sections of text, improving memory efficiency and allowing for better chunking of large documents.

Storing Embeddings in Chroma:
Each document chunk is embedded, and its metadata (source document, section, etc.) is stored in Chroma. Chroma is used as a vector store to persistently store embeddings and metadata. It allows retrieval of embeddings for various use cases, such as search or analysis.

FAISS Integration for Fast Retrieval:
Embeddings generated from the documents are indexed using FAISS. FAISS allows for fast similarity search, enabling quick retrieval of similar chunks or documents based on the embeddings.
The FAISS index is built and persisted to disk (e.g., faiss_IndicBert.index, faiss_mT5.index), so it can be loaded for future similarity search tasks.
Batch Processing for Efficiency:

To optimize the process, embeddings are generated and processed in batches (e.g., batch size of 256). This ensures that large datasets are handled efficiently, without exhausting system memory.

4. RAG
- retriever : DPR, BM25
- generator: mT5
- searching: direct using chroma, chroma + FAISS







----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To achieve the desired solution for the "Multimodal LLM Bot for Service Engineer Support in Indian Languages using RAG," you'll need to break the project down into several steps, each supported by specific Python scripts. Here's an outline of the key components and the corresponding scripts youâ€™ll need to write:

### 1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**
   - **Script 1: Document Preprocessing**  
     - Read and extract text data from the 170 Word and PDF files (manuals, brochures, PPTs).
     - For PDFs: Use libraries like `PyPDF2`, `pdfplumber`, or `fitz` (PyMuPDF).
     - For Word documents: Use `python-docx`.
     - Preprocess the extracted text (cleaning, tokenization, language detection).
     - Split the documents into sections (based on headings or structure) for easier context retrieval.
     - Convert images or diagrams into text descriptions if required for multimodality.

### 2. **Multilingual Data Handling**
   - **Script 2: Language Identification and Translation**  
     - Detect the language of each document or section (you may have a mix of English, Hindi, and regional languages).
     - Translate any content not in supported languages (using `googletrans`, `transformers`, or Indic-specific models like `IndicTrans`).
     - Normalize text to ensure consistency across languages.

### 3. **Training Data Preparation for the LLM**
   - **Script 3: Data Vectorization and Embedding Generation**
     - Convert preprocessed text into token embeddings using `IndicBERT` for Indian languages and `mT5` for generating responses.
     - You can use Hugging Face transformers for this purpose, ensuring that both models can handle multilingual inputs.
     - Store embeddings in a retrieval system (like FAISS) to enable the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow.

### 4. **Building the Retrieval System**
   - **Script 4: Document Retriever**  
     - Implement a retriever for the chatbot using a retriever model (e.g., `DPR` or BM25).
     - Use FAISS or Elasticsearch to search relevant documents based on user queries.
     - Combine the retriever with the generative component (mT5) to form the backbone of the RAG system.

### 5. **RAG-based Question Answering**
   - **Script 5: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model**  
     - Create a script to fetch relevant sections from documents using the retriever.
     - Implement a pipeline that takes input queries from service engineers (via text or voice) and passes them through both the retriever and generator to provide answers.
     - Use `transformers` from Hugging Face for handling RAG, mT5 for the generation, and `TfidfVectorizer` for tokenizing.

### 6. **Multimodal Support (Text, Audio, and Video)**
   - **Script 6: Multimodal Input Processing**  
     - Implement support for voice inputs using libraries like `speech_recognition` or `DeepSpeech`.
     - Process and store audio/video resources in a structured format.
     - Allow the bot to return videos or visual aids alongside text responses.

### 7. **Sentiment Analysis and Escalation**
   - **Script 7: Sentiment Analysis and Priority Assignment**  
     - Use a sentiment analysis model (like `VADER` or `TextBlob` for text, `transformers` for multilingual support) to gauge urgency based on customer tone.
     - Assign priority levels to responses and trigger escalation to human support when necessary.

### 8. **Bot Deployment and Integration**
   - **Script 8: Chatbot Interface (UI/Backend)**  
     - Develop the chatbot interface (you can use `Flask` or `FastAPI` for the backend).
     - Allow users (service engineers) to interact via text or voice commands.
     - Integrate the chatbot with a messaging interface like `Telegram` or `WhatsApp` for real-time interaction.

### 9. **Evaluation and Feedback Loop**
   - **Script 9: Performance Monitoring**  
     - Implement logging for all user queries and responses to gather feedback.
     - Analyze success rates, response times, and user satisfaction to improve the model over time.

By breaking down the project this way, you'll cover all the essential components needed to develop the LLM-based multimodal bot for service engineers.
