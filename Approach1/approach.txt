sentencetransformer to convert to embeddings (expt with diff models)
- various other embeddings model 
- store those embeddings to vector db (chroma)
- chunksize - 250-300 words (expt diff sizes)
- overlap - 50,60,100 words 
- hyperparameter tuning 

2. LLM 
- which model is optimal 
- multilingual 
- use translator as intermediate to translate in English
- response generated in english then translated to required lang (reduce hits on LLM)
- optimization and experimentation 

- after one cylce, optimizise
