Any deviation observed will notify the server through its GSM connectivity. HOW IT WORKS? We interface with other devices like agitator, compressor, generator, etc., and set the parameters to monitor in our system. Any deviation observed by our system will send alert to the server through its GSM connectivity. To measure the milk quantity in the tank we use highly advanced laser beam technology to attain highest level of accuracy. 1.1 Benefits Quantity of Milk The BMC software captures an exact amount of milk stored in the BMC and tracks changes in case of contamination and spillage of milk. Temperature of BMC The BMC monitoring system monitors the accurate temperature in BMC to prevent curdling, souring and spoiling of milk while preserving proper quality. Cleaning-in-process (CIP) Status Hot water CIP is automatically detected. The maximum temperature for hot water and CIP duration is logged. Generator/Power Grid on Status Monitor power supply through a generator or power grid to regulate temperature and quantity of milk in BMC even in the case of power failure. Multiple Agitator Status This feature helps in avoiding icing of milk as agitator rotates continuously in BMC while maintaining a suitable temperature of the milk. Multiple Compressors Status The BMC Smart Box generates proper and required temperature in BMC to retain desired milk quality over a more extended period Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 3BMC smart Box-2 – Service Manual 1.2 Features that Matter Accuracy  For Temperature Sensor: PT100, Accuracy: ± 1°C, Range: 0°C to 70°C  For Level Measurement: ± 3 mm Accuracy Security  Secure data transfer using AES 256 bit Encryption  Role-based user login in device and web application Data Monitoring Any time data access through Dashboards, Live BMC monitoring, Route wise Live BMC Monitoring, Android application, SMS Alerts and Email alerts Data Transfer  Through Pen drive for which USB port is available in system  Through GSM/GPRS to a remote server.

We are going to make the calibration on three different stages. Start-up Login Process:  Press CIP and DIS switches simultaneously after the power on, then system will go to calibration mode.  System will ask for password. Enter password “147”.  It has total F1 to F4 menu  F1: Temperature Calibration  F2: Pressure Calibration  F3: Date & Time  F4: Media 3.1 F1: Temperature Calibration Temperature calibration is done to know the real temperature of Tank. Temperature difference of BMC tank and BMC Smart Box is less than 10C is permissible as per acceptable margin of error. Temperature Calibration is mandatory if the difference is more than 10C between BMC tank and BMC Smart Box. Calibration Process is explained as below.  Press the ENT button on the keypad and enter the username and password.  Go to Calibration Setting and press the ENT button and select the Temperature Calibration.  Now Clear the Temperature calibration.  Now Compare the Reading of BMC Tank and BMC Smart Box.  For comparison follow the below table. F1.1 Lower Reference Temperature Point-1 F1.2 Enter Actual Temperature Point-1 F1.3 Reference Temperature Point-2 F1.4 Enter Actual Temperature Point-2 F1.5 Higher Reference Temperature Point-3 F1.6 Enter Actual Temperature Point-3 F1.7 Clear Temperature Calibration  Maintain at least 150C difference in temperature reading (For example: 00C, 150C, 300C).  While taking the temperature reading difference of temperature is more than 10C then repeat the Temperature Calibration. Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 11BMC smart Box-2 – Service Manual 3.2 F2: Pressure Sensor Calibration Pressure Sensor Calibration is important for proper level. It is divided in two Parts. 1. Zero Calibration 2. Dip Stick Calibration  For the pressure sensor calibration first you need to check the zero value from the Level Chart.  Now add the water in the tank as per KG Unit according to the zero value reading of level chart and wait for 20 minutes to stable the water in the tank. Note: Before starting the calibration select Water in F4: Media. F2.1 Two Point Calibration F2.1.1 Zero Count Display F2.1.2 Zero calibration Count (Add the value in mm as per zero value of level chart) F2.1.3 No Use F2.2 Nine Point Calibration F2.2.1 to Odd menu options are Reference value. Even Menu options are Actual F2.2.18 values. F2.2.19 Clear Nine Point Calibration 3.2.1 Zero Calibration Start the system and do the “Start-up Login Process”.  Press CIP and DIS switches simultaneously after the power on.  It will show F1. Press ↑ button.  It will show F2. Press ENT button.  It will bring to F2.1 Press ENT button.  It will show F2.1.1 Press ENT button.  Here the live count will be displayed, wait to stable count and then Press ENT button.  It will show F2.1.1. Press ↑ button.  It will show F2.1.2, Set the mm value for zero calibration by using ↓ and ↑ keys.  Press ENT button and values will be saved.  Press ESC button and you will be at F2.1  Press ESC button you will be at F1  By pressing ESC button, the system will restart with the new calibration settings. Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 12BMC smart Box-2 – Service Manual 3.2.2 Nine Point (Linear) Calibration  In case of verification, this process is required. It is not compulsory to include.  Start from the “Start-up Login Process” of the system.  Go to F2 by pressing ↑ button and then press ENT button.  F2.1 will be shown, press ↑ button to reach F2.2 then press ENT button.  In F2.2.1 add the first reference value and press ENT button.  In F2.2.2 add first actual value and press ENT button.  In F2.2.3 add the second reference value press ENT button.  In F2.2.4 add second actual value and press ENT button.  In F2.2.5 add the third reference value press ENT button.  In F2.2.5 add third actual value and press ENT button.  Do the same process to add more records till F2.2.18.  Values F2.2.1 to F2.2.18 are values which can be set.  Value F2.2.19 is for clearing the records. By going on F2.2.19 press ENT button, Option for CLEAR CALIBRATION will be seen.  Select YES to clear calibration and NO to keep old calibration with ↓ button and ↑ button. Press ENT button to select. 3.2.3 Dip Stick Calibration Another calibration for Pressure / Level is Dip Stick Calibration. Zero Calibration is mandatory and after completing that calibration level in the tank and level shown by BMC monitoring system is almost same. Level difference in 3mm or 20 Liter/KG is permissible as per acceptable margin of error, but if difference is more than acceptable margin of error then Dip Stick Calibration is require.  Add the water in the tank up to half level of the tank.  Now reset the linear calibration (Calibration -> Linear Calibration -> Reset)  Now go to Calibration Menu.  Pressure Sensor Calibration -> Add -> Dip Stick Calibration.  If you want to set BMC smart box as per purchase then compare the Dip Stick reading with Level Chart and add the Add the Quantity as per level chart in Liter.  If you want to set BMC Smart Box as per Dip Stick then add the reading in mm as per Dip Stick level. Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 13BMC smart Box-2 – Service Manual 3.3 F3: Set Date and Time  Follow the: “Start-up Login Process” to enter in Menu options.  It will show the value F1 on the LED display.  By using the UP ↑ button, go to F2.
