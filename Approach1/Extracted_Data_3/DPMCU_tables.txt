MilkoScreen
MilkoScreen accurately measures fat, SNF and protein-based
on proven FT-Infrared Technology. It also detects various
adulterants such as added water, urea, sucrose, maltodextrin,
and ammonium sulphate present in the milk.
Milkochill
Milkochill Milk Chiller brings the benefits of instant milk
chilling by bringing down the temperature of milk up to 7
degree Celsius right after milking. The system provides for
instant chilling of milk even in the absence of electricity to
ensure the quality of milk is retained at the source and
bacterial growth is arrested.
Smartbox
SmartBox is designed to monitor Bulk Milk Coolers (BMC) to
keep track of milk quantity, temperature, compressor, and
agitator status. Any deviation observed will notify the server
and the end-user through its GSM connectivity.
