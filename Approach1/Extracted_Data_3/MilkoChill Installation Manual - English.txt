Ltd. (Instant Milk Chiller Division) 2) Installation 2.1 Things to remember for Installation  Installation place should have a proper shade; direct sunlight should not fall on the chiller.  Back side of the chiller should be at least 3 feet away from the wall. Maintain Distance minimum 3’ (feet) between Exhaust fan & Wall  Chiller should be placed inside a closed room having a proper ventilation.  Installation surface should be hard and properly leveled. Electrical requirement  Power Supply: 230 ± 10% AC, single phase, 50 Hz.  Two 3 pin sockets. One 15A for MilkoChill and other 5A for service/installation purpose 3 Pin Socket having Current Capacity 15A and 5A  Voltage stabilizer is required where there are frequent voltage fluctuations.  Inverter may be required for power backup if electricity available is less than 12 hours a day. Page | 6Prompt Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Instant Milk Chiller Division) Material requirement  For cooling unit: 160 Ltr. and HRU: 140 Ltr, Filtered or Mineral water. Total 300 Ltr. (One- time requirement)  Tap water supply: 130 Ltr. / day for CIP (cleaning of MilkoChill)  For HRU Inlet/Outlet water: Minimum flow rate: 80 LPH with overhead water tank (at least 3-4 feet above ground level or Submersible water pump 30/40 Watt Single Phase (Optional) and outlet pipe. 2.2 Installation procedure  Locate the chiller on a hard-levelled surface. Adjustable legs can be used to properly level the chiller. By using Adjustable leg level the system properly 2.2.1 Compressor Cable connections  Remove the cable of compressor from contactor so that compressor does not accidently start before it is ready. Disconnect compressor cable from contactor Page | 7Prompt Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Instant Milk Chiller Division) 2.2.2 Filling water inside cooling tank  Open the drain plug of the cooling tank located at the back side of the chiller. Close the valve after wrapping Teflon tape on the thread of the plug.  Keep 160 liters of filtered water ready. It can be filled in 40 liters cans. Ensure that the cans are clean before filling water into it.  Pouring water in the cooling tank from the inlet water plug (by using submersible pump or by making water level difference).  Fill the cooling tank until it is about to overflow. Approximately ~160 liters of water go inside the cooling tank.  Close the inlet water plug. Cooling unit is now filled with water. Inlet Water Plug: (Fill 160 litre water from this plug) (Close plug with Teflon tape) Drain Water Plug: (Close plug with Teflon tape) 2.2.3 Filling water inside Heat Recovery Unit (HRU)  Open the drain cap of the HRU located at the back side of the chiller. Close the cap after wrapping Teflon tape on the thread.  Keep 140 liters of filtered water ready. It can be filled in 40 liters cans. Ensure that the cans are clean before filling water into it.  Follow the same procedure as cooling tank water filling. Fill the HRU until it is about to overflow. Approximately ~130 liters of water go inside the HRU.  Close the inlet end cap. HRU is now filled with water. Water Inlet connection with End cap (Filling water from this port until overflow from this line) Water drain (Close end cap with Teflon tape) Page | 8Prompt Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (Instant Milk Chiller Division) 2.2.4 Switch ON the main switch  Connect the Battery wire Battery cable to PCB (Previous Position) Connect the Battery cable to PCB  Insert the main power cable of the chiller into 3 pin sockets.  Turn ON the Main MCB switch then Mains LED will glow.
