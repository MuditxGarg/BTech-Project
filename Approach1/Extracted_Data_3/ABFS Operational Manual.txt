1. Introduction Prompt CE Certified automatic bag filling system is an automatic weigh filler, built with self-optimizing controls that precisely configured to your specific material flow, speed & accuracy requirements for providing you with accurate results. Specifically catering to the industries that deal in granules, the Automatic Bag Filling System is built with an intelligent program and high-speed operation that provides efficiency in your day-to-day production. This machine is mainly built keeping in mind granular products like rice, pulses, animal feed, maize, soybeans, seeds, plastic granules, Animal Feed, Maize, Soybeans and Seeds etc. Built to offer complete efficiency, the speed it can reach up to is 14 bags per minute. The Bag Packing Machine is designed in an extremely user-friendly manner with a 10-inch touch screen that depicts a real-time display of the machine’s status, weight it has detected, information of the recipe, whether the feeding is fast or slow and other key information. 1.1 Highlights of Bag Filling Machine Specially designed for granular products Standard flange interface that can easily be mounted directly below the storage The food contacting materials are all made of SS304 stainless steel and can be used for food packaging Equipped with a self-optimizing intelligent program for high-speed operation High-speed Stepper motor mechanism instead of Pneumatic shutter gate mechanism for feed control. Auto intelligence programmed Controller instead of Manual settings of the program. Auto Free-fall compensation as per material flow 10’ Inch big HMI display for Data monitoring and Data Logging, real-time display of current status, detection of weight, recipe information, fast/ slow feeding and other key data. 20 types of recipe can add CE Certified Dual serial port RS232/RS485, Modbus TCP/IP USB Pen drive interface for further data inspection. Low & easy maintenance design. 1.2 Technical Specification 2. Operational SOP
