METHOD OF MB CARD & DB CARD MAPPING PROCESS 1. Before mapping MB card and DB card to check version of both cards. MB card version should be 6.0.X.X and DB card version 3.0.X.X. 2. Machine ID (0000000000) will appear on the display after starting Accumulation Analyzer. According to the serial number of the machine in production, the ten digit serial number (1019070001) should be saved in the MB card. 3. Keep “READY FOR SYSTEM SETTING” in Accumulation Analyzer. 4. Connect the Bluetooth dongle to the machine and open the mobile application CONFIG PLUS and select the version of Accumulation Analyzer. 5. Go to system setting and write Analyzer machine serial number and save. 6. After saving the ten digit serial number (1019070001) in the MB card, shut down the machine. 7. Keep the OK button pressed and turn on the power switch of the machine. After ENTER PASSWORD is written on the display, release the OK button. 8. Enter USER PASSWORD in ENTER PASSWORD and press OK button. 9. Go to BOARD PAIRING option in USER setting menu and press OK button. READY FOR PAIRING message will appear on the display. 10. Connect the Bluetooth dongle to the machine and open the CONFIG PLUS mobile application, go to the menu bar and select the MEASUREMENT BOARD SETTING option. It will show two settings. 11. SET MEASUREMENT BOARD MACHINE ID AND PCB PAIRING 12. First selecting SET MEASUREMENT BOARD MACHINE ID option the message of MEASUREMENT BOARD MACHINE ID SAVE SUCCESSFULLY will appear in the application. 13. Then select PCB PAIRING option. A PCB PAIRING SUCCESSFULLY message will appear in the application. 14. Then select PCB PAIRING option. A PCB PAIRING SUCCESSFULLY message will appear in the application.

BATTERY VOLTAGE:  If the battery voltage is more than 13.50V then the LED will not turn on.  If the battery voltage is 13.0V to 13.50 then the LED will be on.  If the battery voltage is 12.50 to 13.0V then the LED will blink every second.  If the battery voltage is 12.0 to 12.50V, the LED will blink every 500 milliseconds.  If the battery voltage is less than 12.0V, the LED will not turn on. PEPL/SOP/MFG2/PRD/79 15C. SOLAR CHARGER PCB TESTING PROCESS 1. To set solar voltage 14.20VDC from pot R40. 2. Place the probe on the Signal Transformer to set the solar voltage. 3. To set battery charging voltage 14.55 from pot R27. 4. Place the probe on BAT+ to set the battery charging voltage. 5. Checking how many amperes of solar and SMPS charge the battery. 6. Placing an ampere meter in series with the battery. 7. To give the voltage of solar. Do not supply voltage of SMPS. 8. Checking the solar voltage should show 0.50-2.50 ampere of battery. 9. Supply voltage of SMPS. Do not give solar voltage. 10. Checking SMPS voltage should show 1.50-2.50 ampere of battery. 11. To check amperage of solar and SMPS with load applied. 12. Placing an ampere meter in series with the load. 13. To provide the same solar voltage. Do not supply voltage of SMPS. 14. Works well from solar to 3.0 ampere load. 15. Supply voltage of a single SMPS. Do not give solar voltage. 16. The SMPS is running correctly giving a load of 10.0 ampere.
