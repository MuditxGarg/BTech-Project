image, keep pressing the
plunger up and down.
Repeat this process 15-20
times. Remove the bottle
when cleaning water
comes out from the
pipette.	Again keep pressing the

Table 13:
35ml
Milk
Take the 40ml sample bottle given
along with the Milk analyzer and take
the at least 35ml water in bottle.	An Ultrasonic stirrer has been given
with the Milk Analyzer package.
This is a very important device for milk
analysis.
Take the milk sample bottle and put it
in the stirrer. There should be
minimum 10 seconds stirring time for
the sample.
Afterwards, Press OK button.	

Table 14:
Take the milk in the milk sample bottle,
put it under the pipette of Analyzer and
Press OK button. Milk will be absorbed
from the pipette.		After pressing OK, the machine will start
the milk analysis of the sample. You will
see WORKING… message on screen with
blocks showing progress.	
The result will show the FAT%, SNF%,
Added Water% and Density of the milk.
This is your desired result. If a DPU or
computer system connected with the
analyzer, the readings will be
transferred there automatically.		After the sampling is over, the
milk will automatically come
into the sample bottle. Till then
do not move the bottle from the
pipette.
This Process is same for all
Samples. Take the next sample
and start with stirring the
sample and then Analysis.	
	NOTE: Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test		
	the same sample, take a fresh raw milk sample from the farmer		
	and measure the FAT again.
