The smart milk analyzer can be calibrate using the Bluetooth and mobile application. Prompt’s milk analyzer is India’s first technically advanced ultrasonic milk analyzer, which is designed to measure milk FAT-SNF, ADDED WATER, and milk DENSITY. This FAT & SNF testing machine is highly efficacious that renders consistent performance over an extended period with maintaining accuracy and fully protected calibration. 2 | Pa ge iSmart Milk Analyzer - User Manual1.2 Things to Remember During the Installation Process of Smart Milk Analyzer  Keep the Smart Milk Analyzer machine in a clean and tidy place.  Smart Milk Analyzer can be operated with 230 volt AC OR 12 volt DC. If the voltage of AC supply is not stable (between 180 Volts to 260 Volts) then use stabilizer or UPS.  Mineral water, RO water or Distilled water can be used to clean the Smart Milk Analyzer.  Add 35ml milk in sample bottle.  In a Smart Milk Analyzer, filter the milk sample before testing the milk FAT.  The temperature of milk should be less than 40oC, if the temperature is more than 40oC then there will be error of “Error-2 HOT / NO SAMPLE” in the machine.  Before measuring the FAT of milk sample in a Smart Milk Analyzer, Stir the milk and then measure the FAT so air bubbles will remove from the RAW milk. Stir the milk for 15 second if the temperature of milk sample is less than 15oC and Stir the milk for 10 second if the temperature of milk sample is greater than 15oC.  Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw sample of milk from the farmer and measure the FAT again.  Clean the machine two or three times with clean water before starting milk collection and also with clean water three times after the milk collection is completed.  After the collection is completed in each shift, prepare a mixture of Daily Cleaner 5% and Water 95% and clean Smart Milk Analyzer, then clean 15-20 times with the same solution using a plunger.  After the every 15 days, prepare a mixture of Power/Monthly Cleaner 10% and Water 90% and clean Smart Milk Analyzer.  Clean the Smart Milk Analyzer with a plunger and water if supply is gone out while measuring FAT.  After collection of milk and final cleaning, take water in the beaker and load it in the Smart Milk Analyzer so that no waste or germs can go inside the Smart Milk Analyzer. 3 | Pa ge iSmart Milk Analyzer - User Manual1.3 Technical Specification of Smart Milk Analyzer (Option 1) AC mains Power Supply Input voltage 230 Volt ± 15 – 20 % Input current 0.4 Amp.
