FEATURES: Data Capture Data Transfer How do we • Milk Quantity • To Pen Drive through the USB port • Milk Temperature • To remote server through GSM/GPRS • Power Status (Generator/AC Mains) • Multiple Compressor & Agitator ON/OFF Status Dispatch keep it pure? • Max temperature of hot water and CIP duration • Energy Meter Interface (Optional) • Details like actual dispatch, remaining quantity, temperature, compressor, agitator and generator ON/ The system offers web-supported SMS and Email alerts OFF are logged for above data. • The user can also enter DIP stick reading and tanker Security number • Secure data transfer using a 256-bit Encryption Prompt provides innovative solutions for an the milk during chilling and storage phase, technique Cleaning in Process (CIP) efficient dairy procurement supply chain. From through real time monitoring of parameters such • Role-based user login in a web application • Max. Temperature of hot water and CIP duration is Cleaning-in-Process (CIP) logged farm management and milk collection to quality as Milk Volume, Temperature, CIP Status, Agitator Data Monitoring Reports analysis and preservation, we have different Status, and Power/Generator Status in the BMC. • Dashboard shows BMC Milk Status for particular BMC, • Reports for milk data, offline BMC device, shift equipment and software to ensure that the purity Real time App assisted alerts are sent out which Day’s Highest Procurement, Milk Summary according complete, date and route-wise dispatch, generator to milk type, avg. fat and SNF, etc. used status, dispatch, high temperature in BMC, etc. of milk is retained at every step. Our unique support timely actions to maintain purity of milk. are generated • Route-wise Live BMC Monitoring shows graph and records for milk quantity, temperature, agitator & offering, the BMC SmartBox maintains purity of compressor ON/OFF status for each BMC on the route. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: Our resource in this pursuit – Prompt’s Controller PIC32 Based Controller • Seven Segment Display BMC SmartBox (Bulk Milk Cooler Display • LEDs For Indication of Low Battery, External Supply, Sim Network, Mains Power, Generator, Multiple Agitators On/Off And Multiple Compressors On/Off Storage/Media Type Micro SD Monitoring System) Capacity 4 GB (In-Built) – Expandable Up To 8 GB – Unlimited Data Storage GSM Module (Optional) GSM/GPRS Quad Band Module THE MOST VALUABLE SYSTEM LINK Keyboard Six Keys For User Entry IN THE CHAIN OF MILK MANAGEMENT USB Ports 1 USB Port Clock Built-In Real Time Clock for Date and Time BMC center has an important place in the milk For Temperature For Level Measurement Base System For the Power Consumption of BMC supply chain. How the bulk of milk collected here is • Sensor: PT100 • Accuracy of Volume: ±0.4% • Energy Meter (Optional) Sensor Modules • Accuracy: ± 1° C of BMC Capacity monitored, to retain its quality, affects the final value • Range: 0°C To 70°C • IP67 Electrical Connection of milk at the production level. BMC SmartBox helps • Operative Temperature : 0 To 65°C (32°F To 149°F) Environment take care of the precious milk by enabling people • Relative Humidity : 5% To 85% RH Non Condensing at BMC centers and dairy plants remotely track the Power Supply 180- 260 Volts, 50 Hz monitoring of milk coolers in real-time. It also uses Power Consumption 15 Watts highly advanced laser beam technology to measure Battery Backup 4400mAh Li-lon Battery which provides 5 hrs. Battery Backup the milk quantity in the tank to attain the highest level of accuracy and notifies the server through its GSM connectivity in case of any deviation. WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS? Makes BMC operationally efficient Informed decision making Real-time monitoring Sends alerts via SMS, BMC capacities – 500/1000/ and remote tracking Mobile App, and Email 3000/5000/10000 litres Real-time alerts, tracking and monitoring makes BMC BMC SmartBox is based on IoT technology with cloud operationally efficient. It helps the dairy in controlling the connectivity, giving detailed data analytics on web operational costs associated with running the BMC with the application. This allows the dairy to make informed Multiple compressor Designated App for Measures Quantity, Temperature, help of BMC SmartBox. business decisions. and generator/power dairy plant managers Agitator - for mixing, Compressor, grid on status and BMC operators CIP – cleaning in process Quality of Milk is retained Monitors quantity of milk With continual monitoring, the desired temperature of milk in Keeps the user updated about the quantity of the milk in the BMC is maintained, which prevents curdling, souring and the BMC and the quantity of milk when taken out of the spoiling of milk, thus preserving proper milk quality. Good tank after dispatch to the Chilling Centre. This helps avoid quality of milk serves as a good raw-material for value added any theft of milk. products manufactured by dairy.
