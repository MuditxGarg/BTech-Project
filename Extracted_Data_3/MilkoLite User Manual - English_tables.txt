Table 4:
	
Plug in MilkoLite power cable into Mains supply board and “ON” AC power switch.	Once power of MilkoLite is ON, Display will show MILK MILKOLITE.
	
Next FAT, SNF AND ADDED WATER TEST shows on display.	Next, version number shows on display.
	
Next, MACHINE ID will appear on MilkoLite display.	After, you will see WARM UP message. It may take up to a minute.
	
Then CLEANING CYCLES message appears on display, here user need to clean MilkoLite (with water) with minimum 025 cycles.	After successfully start-up cleaning, “CLEANING OVER” shows on display. Now, your milk MilkoLite is ready to work.

Table 5:
	
Take the 40ml sample bottle given along with the MilkoLite and take at least 35ml water in bottle.	An Ultrasonic stirrer has been given 
with the MilkoLite package. 
This is a very important device for milk analysis.
	
Take the milk sample bottle and put it in the stirrer. There should be minimum 10 seconds stirring time for the sample.
Afterwards, Press OK button.	

Table 6:
	
Take the milk in the milk sample bottle, put it under the pipette of MilkoLite and Press OK button. Milk will be absorbed from the pipette.	After pressing OK, the machine will start the milk analysis of the sample. You will see WORKING… message on screen with blocks showing progress.
	
The result will show the FAT%, SNF%, Added Water% and Density of the milk. This is your desired result. If a DPU or computer system connected with the MilkoLite, the readings will be transferred there automatically.	
NOTE: Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw milk sample from the farmer and measure the FAT again.	NOTE: Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw milk sample from the farmer and measure the FAT again.

Table 7:
	
Take the clean water in sample bottle.	Put the sample bottle below the pipette of MilkoLite, and press the OK button. 
	
The result should come like:
FAT %: 0.00 | SNF %: 0.00 | 
Added Water %: 100 | Density: 0.00	

Table 8:
	
Take Clean Water / Mineral Water / RO Water in Sample Bottle and put sample bottle under the Pipette of MilkoLite.	Press CLEAN button and 25 cleaning cycles will be seen. You can increase or decrease the cleaning cycle using ▼ and ▲ button. Then press OK button.
	
After staring of first cleaning cycle, REMAINING CYCLES will appear on display.	After finishing, you will receive the CLEANING OVER message.

Table 9:
 	
The sample bottle is of 40ml. Fill the sample bottle with approx. 38ml clean water.
Take 2 ml (Approx. 15 to 20 drops) of Daily Cleaner, in the sample bottle.	This will make a mixture of 5% cleaning solution and 95% of water.
Now the solution is ready for cleaning.
Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity. It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite.	Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity. It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite.

Table 10:
	
Now put this sample bottle below the pipette of MilkoLite & press CLEAN button.	You can increase or decrease cycles by using ▼ and ▲ button. Press on OK button to start cleaning process.

Table 11:
  	
The sample bottle is of 40ml. Fill the sample bottle with approx. 36ml clean water.
Take 4 ml (Approx. 25 to 30 drops) of Monthly/Power Cleaner in the sample bottle.	This will make a mixture of 10% cleaning solution and 90% of water.
Now the Cleaning solution is ready for cleaning.
Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity.  It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite.	Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity.  It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite.

Table 12:
	
Now put this sample bottle below the pipette of MilkoLite & press CLEAN button.	You can increase or decrease cycles by using ▼ and ▲ button. Press on OK button to start cleaning process.

Table 13:
		
After cleaning is done with Daily Cleaner, Turn off the supply of MilkoLite and remove the Rubber Plug from top of the MilkoLite.	Now, take the plunger which is given in the accessories box and stuck it in the hole on the top.	Now as shown in the image, keep pressing the plunger down forcefully.
		
Now take clean water in sample bottle and put it under the pipette.	Now as shown in the image, keep pressing the plunger up and down. Repeat this process 15-20 times. Remove the bottle when cleaning water comes out from the pipette.	Again keep pressing the plunger slowly up and down, so there is no water in MilkoLite. 
Attach the rubber plug back on the top.

Table 14:
	
Take the Clean water in sample bottle and put the sample bottle below the pipette.	Then press the OK button. Water will automatically inserted through the pipette into MilkoLite.
	
You will see the WORKING… message on the screen after pressing OK button.	When 2 dots appear below the WORKING… message then quickly turn off the ON/OFF switch of Milk MilkoLite. ON/OFF Switch is at the back panel of Milk MilkoLite.
