End Page 7Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1 4 SETUP FOR CALIBRATION For the calibration of smart milk analyzer, some basic requirements are there which are explained below. 4.1 Smart Milk Analyzer This calibration process explained here is for the Smart Milk Analyzer of the version 1.2.2.1 and onwards. The process will not be same for any other version of the Milk Analyzer. 4.2 Ultrasonic Stirrer Ultrasonic stirrer is the part of the Milk Analyzer. The stirrer works on the ultrasonic sound wave principle and makes the milk ready for the Milk Analysis by removing Air bubbles from the Milk. The sample used for the calibration must be applied on stirrer before checked in the Analyzer. Page 8Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1 4.3 Milk Samples – Checked by Reference Methods The RAW MILK samples are taken for the calibration by the reference methods of Gerber for FAT% and Lactometer for SNF%. For milk sampling the user have to take at least 5 samples of 250ml between minimum range of FAT & SNF and maximum range of FAT & SNF. Sample FAT SNF 1 3.0 % - 4.5 % 2 5.0 % - 6.0 % 5 Samples which are having SNF 3 6.5 % - 7.5 % range from 8% to 12% 4 8.0 % - 9.0 % 5 9.0 % - 10.0 % 4.4 Bluetooth Dongle and Mobile Application A Bluetooth dongle is specially designed Prompt EMT is a special mobile to calibrate the Milk Analyzer by the application which is made for the mobile application. It is given with the calibration and is given to be installed Milk Analyzer. into the smart phone. Page 9Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1 5 SAMPLE TAKEN FOR CALIBRATION We have taken 5 samples for this calibration, for which we have tested FAT from Gerber method and SNF from Lactometer method. Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3 Sample 4 Sample 5 FAT: 4.72% FAT: 5.23% FAT: 6.82% FAT: 8.54% FAT: 9.58% SNF: 8.59% SNF: 10.68% SNF: 9.99% SNF: 11.10% SNF: 10.60% It is mandatory to take the samples in such a way, by labeling the sample numbers along with the reference FAT and SNF noted down.

Page 19Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1 10.2 Difference of Reference Data & Analyzer Data Now, the next screen will show the data of reference and analyzer sample data.  New screen will be New Analyzer Data.  This will show the screen like beside with FAT and SNF values with difference.  These values will be fetched automatically from the analyzer based on the actions done by us.  On the left side, FAT values are coming, in which the upper value is showing the reference value entered manually and the lower value shows the value received by the analyzer reading. Beside each value, a difference is coming between the reference value and value received by the analyzer. The red font shows the analyzer reading comes less than reference value and green one shows analyzer value is higher than reference.  Same way the right side will show the SNF values.  All the calculation has made automatically.  Now press NEXT option on bottom. Page 20Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1 10.3 Final Calibration Screen Now, we will see the final calibration screen as below.  Now this is the final screen for the calibration.  This will show the ref machine type 1 and machine id of the analyzer which was seen while power on.  Below that, old Slope FAT and SNF, old Intercept FAT and SNF and Accuracy of FAT and SNF will be seen. These values will be calculated automatically.  Below, the option will be for S/I; which shows new Slope FAT and SNF, new Intercept FAT and SNF and Accuracy of FAT and SNF. These values will be calculated automatically.  Recommended SNF slop value should be between 0.75 to 1.35.  Here as per calculation SNF slop is between the recommended SNF Slop values, so APPLY button is enabled.  Press the APPLY button. Page 21Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1  You will see the Bias settings below the S/I option.  This is also another calculation method for the calibration.  This will also show the new Slope FAT and SNF, new Intercept FAT and SNF and Accuracy of FAT and SNF.  Below that, you will see the APPLY button. Press APPLY button. After pressing the button, you will CALIBRATED SUCCESSFULLY receive the message, which shows the calibration is done successfully. Page 22Smart Milk Analyzer 1.2.X.X – Calibration SOP Document Version 1.1 11 CHECK REFERENCE SAMPLE Now, log out from the mobile application. To verify the calibration, it is recommended to check a reference sample once in the analyzer. Take reference sample. Attach the sample to stirrer and Press OK. You will get the READY screen on the display. You will get the resultant values of the Press OK for the results. taken Sample. The reference sample taken here is sample 5, which is having the reference FAT% 9.58 and SNF% 10.60. The output received here is FAT% 9.37 and SNF% 10.59. We are getting the FAT% difference of 0.2% and SNF% difference of 0.01%, which is acceptable. This says that the calibration has been completed successfully. If the different between the received value and reference value is too high, then the entire calibration process will have to be done again.
