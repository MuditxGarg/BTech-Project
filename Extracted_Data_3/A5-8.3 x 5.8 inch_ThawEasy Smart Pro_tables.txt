Operating Instructions:
1. How to Adjust the Set Temperature: Temperature will be set
from Cloud.
2.How to Adjust Set Duration (Time): Duration will be set
from Cloud.
3.How to Initiate Thawing:
Powering On:
Place "ThawEasy Smart Pro" on a stable, flat surface.
Switch on the machine using the power button located
at the back.
The machine's display will show information about the
firmware version.
Connect the Thawing machine with the mobile app
through Bluetooth.
Machine Setup:
Fill/top up the water bath pipe with 50ml of clean RO water at
room temperature (Between 25°C to Set Temp.)
Ensure the water level is at the top.
Mobile app will show you error notification if water is
less then 40ml.
Water Heating:
Press the "Start Thawing" button from Mobile app. to initiate
water heating.
The display of Machine and Mobile app. will indicate the
water temperature, which will gradually rise.
After some time the machine will automatically activate the
vibrator for even heating.
Once it reaches the set temperature the machine will hold
the set temperature for 30 seconds to ensure set temperature
stability.
Once the water temperature reaches desired temperature
LED lite of machine ready will be On, Machine buzzer will ring
& Also on the mobile app a animation of inserting the straw
will displayed.
Once the machine is ready for thawing proceed for thawing.
4.How to Initiate Thawing:
Thawing Process:
Put the straw in side the device.
The machine will commence a countdown for the pre-set
thawing duration.
When the countdown concludes, the buzzer will sound again,
signaling animation in the mobile app to removal of the straw.
Completing the Process:
Remove the straw from the machine.
The machine will cease heating of water and enter in sleep
mode, also display will be in off mode.
Automatically next screen will come to complete the AI
process in the mobile app.	Start Thawing Process Wait till water

		Prompt THAWEASY with a Bluetooth
enabled Mobile App is a digital solution
which automates the entire thawing
process and ensures that the correct
SOP of thawing is followed.
The regulatory sensors and controls have
been crafted with high mechanical
precision to ensure correct thawing
of the semen sample.
It is possible to program the equipment
with different combinations of time and
temperature for various kinds of semen
samples for different types of animals.
All the data related to thawing
processes are stored in real-time
enabling decision making.	Prompt THAWEASY with a Bluetooth

Precaution & Warning:
Do not try to Avoid using machine Do not fill water
open machine directly in rain directly from Tap
1. Avoid Overfilling: Do not exceed the recommended water
quantity when filling the water bath pipe.
2. Do not fill water directly below the tap or flowing water, this
is electronic device and exposure to the flowing water may
case damaged to the device.
3. Do not submerged the device in water for cleaning or filling
water in the water bath pipe.
4. Do not use any harsh chemical such as caustic, Detergent or
soap or acid to clean the machine.
5. Unstable Placement: Avoid placing the machine on an
unstable or tilted surface to prevent accidents.	6. Abrasive Cleaning: Do not use abrasive materials for cleaning
to avoid damage to the machine’s internal & external surfaces.
7. Forceful Button Pressing: Avoid forceful or excessive pressing
of buttons, especially during temperature and duration
adjustments.
8. Power Interruption: Do not turn off the power abruptly during
