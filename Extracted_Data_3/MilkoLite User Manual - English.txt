1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 About Product The MilkoLite analyzes the raw milk and gets the substances details like FAT%, SNF%, ADDED WATER%, and DENSITY. Also able to provide PROTEIN, LACTOSE and SALT. Calibration of MilkoLite can be done through Mobile Application as well as manual. Prompt’s MilkoLite is highly efficacious that renders consistent performance over an extended period with maintaining accuracy and fully protected calibration. 1.2 Things to Remember During the Installation Process of MilkoLite Keep the MilkoLite machine in a clean and tidy place. MilkoLite can be operated with 230 volt AC OR 12 volt DC. If the voltage of AC supply is not stable (between 180 Volts to 260 Volts) then use stabilizer or UPS. Mineral water, RO water or Distilled water can be used to clean the MilkoLite. Take 30ml to 35ml milk in sample bottle. In a MilkoLite, filter the milk sample before testing the milk. The temperature of milk should be less than 40oC, if the temperature is more than 40oC then there will be error of “Error-2 HOT / NO SAMPLE” in the machine. Before analysis of milk sample in a MilkoLite, Stir the milk and then analyze the milk so air bubbles will remove from the RAW milk. Stir the milk for 15 second if the temperature of milk is less than 15oC and Stir the milk for 10 second if the temperature of milk is greater than 15oC. Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw sample of milk from the farmer and analyze again. Clean the machine two or three times with clean water before starting milk collection and also with clean water three times after the milk collection is completed. After the collection is completed in each shift, prepare a mixture of Daily Cleaner 5% and Water 95% and clean MilkoLite, then clean 15-20 times with the same solution using a plunger. After the every 15 days, prepare a mixture of Power/Monthly Cleaner 10% and Water 90% and clean MilkoLite. Clean the MilkoLite with a plunger and water if supply is gone out while analyzing a milk sample. After collection of milk and final cleaning, take water in the beaker and load it in the MilkoLite so that no waste or germs can go inside the MilkoLite. 1.3 Technical Specification of MilkoLite 1.4 Features of MilkoLite Fast, Automatic and simple one touch testing Simple and light weight Design Low power consumption +12 volt DC or 230 volt AC power supply Minimal milk use for testing No acids or other chemicals are used for testing Better accuracy and repeatability Testing of milk with appropriate accuracy by selection of 1 or 2 decimal points Fully protected Bluetooth-calibration from mobile only by authorized person FAT-SNF based single calibration curve Suitable for Indian conditions - Durable in all weathers 1.5 Parameter Settings for Interfacing of Computer with MilkoLite Milk Sample data is single or continuously transmit as per Following string Details, String is made by ASCII format. And 31 characters are there in ASCII format string. TOTAL STRING: (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) HERE ST STRING = ( ENDING STRING = ) XXXX are string data, and total 29 characters are as under, 1ST Character to 4TH Character = FAT DATA 5TH Character to 8TH Character = SNF DATA 9TH Character to 12TH Character = DENSITY DATA 13TH Character to 16TH Character = ADDED WATER DATA 17TH Character to 29TH Character = CORRECTION DATA (For our machine it is always 0) FOR EXAMPLE, FAT= 8.25, SNF = 9.54, DENSITY = 28.57 AND ADDED WATER = 06 % then string is as under (08250954285706000000000000000). 1.6 Accessories Box of MilkoLite 2 MILKOLITE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE 2.1 Front Panel The front panel will show the screen and four buttons.

The ignorance will NOT give you the real FAT and SNF of the sample milk. 5.2 Milk Sample Analysis 6 CLEANING PROCESS Cleaning for MilkoLite is required before starting the shift and after the end of the shift. Water cleaning is an important part of the MilkoLite operational procedure. Before starting of milk collection, clean twice with different clean water and then test twice with clean water. Test with clean water once the shift is over, and then clean twice with clean water. Cleaning daily with daily solution after the shift and once every 15 days with power / monthly solution. After cleaning with solution, clean with plunger and then clean again with clean water. 5.1 FAT Testing with Clean Water 6.2 Cleaning Process with Clean Water 6.3 Cleaning Process with Solution 6.3.1 Making of Daily Cleaner 5.3.2 Daily Solution Cleaning Process 6.3.3 Making of Power/Monthly Cleaner 6.3.4 Power/Monthly Solution Cleaning Process 6.4 Manual Cleaning with Plunger After solution cleaning is over, user need to perform plunger cleaning manually as shown in below method. 7 METHOD OF CLOSING MILKOLITE AFTER COMPLETION OF EACH SHIFT After the Milk collection completed in each shift, take clean water in beaker and put that below the Pipette of Milk MilkoLite so Garbage or insects cannot enter through the pipette in MilkoLite. 8 Settings and Calibration Note: Press the OK button and then power on the MilkoLite, Keep pressing OK button until Enter Password is showing on Display. 9 ERROR LIST AND ITS REMEDIES PROMPT HELPLINE Thank you for using the Prompt MilkoLite Milk Analyzer.
