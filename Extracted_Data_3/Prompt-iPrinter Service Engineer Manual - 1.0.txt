INTRODUCTION 11..11 OObbjjeeccttiivvee To provide an intelligent printing interface to any RS232 output capable device to enable data recording and analytics. 11..22 WWhhaatt iitt DDooeess?? The system provides an intelligent Printing interface to any device giving RS232 output to enable data recording and analytics apart from generating print output. The system intefaces with such a device and stores the data before printing the same. The intelligent printer works as any other Thermal Printer apart from capturing and storing all data. 11..33 AAbboouutt PPrroodduucctt The aim of the device is to get data from machine, store data to the SD card, send and receive data via Bluetooth, and print the data on Prompt-iPrinter. However, the above functionality can be configured to modify or change the device operation as per requirement. Prompt-iPrinter is a cost effective solution to get all the sample result on web through low cost Prompt-iPrinter. Prompt-iPrinter prints more quietly and usually faster than impact dot matrix printers. They are also compact in size, lighter in weight and consume less power, making them ideal for portable and custom applications. There will be a provision of extra serial port that can be used to send machine data to PC through RS232 cable. This Prompt-iPrinter is highly efficacious and renders consistent performance over an extended period of time maintaining high level of accuracy.

String Parameter Configuration is used to process the raw string received from the machine and store data in specific file.  Storing of Data in SD card: SD card will generate a file every day with the date and machine id as a file name. The very first record of the day will generate the new file and the next records will be appended and so on till the next day.  Access Device Configuration: The configuration parameter discussed above will be saved in a file in the SD card. If any parameter is changed then the file will be updated. On every start-up, MCU will first read this configuration file, and take the available parameters into consideration.  Get Data to Android App: There is a functionality to send data of the SD card to the Android App through Bluetooth. For this operation, App has to provide the date of record, MCU will search the received date file in SD card and send the records if the received date file is present.  Print data from Android App: If user wants to print the record of any date, App can share the date to MCU and MCU will search that date file in the SD card if the file found then MCU will print the records on Prompt- iPrinter. Page 17Prompt-iPrinter – Installation Manual Document Version 1.0 For Service Engineer 6 CLEANING OF THE PROMPT-IPRINTER We need to clean the print head if the following problems occur: 1. Printing is not clear, but thermal paper is ok; 2. Some columns on the printed pages are not clear 3. Noisy paper feeding. CLEANING STEPS 1. Turn off the power, open the printer cover and take off the paper roll. 2. We have to wait for a while if we just finished the printing. 3. Use a soft brush or wrung-out ethanol immerged cotton to clean the print head. Remember to turn on the gear while lubricating to ensure complete lubrication. 4. Close the cover once cleaning done and try it later. CAUTIONS:  Make sure the power of the printer is turned off during the maintenance.  Keep hands or other metal tools away from the surface of the printer head, do not use tweezers to scratch the surface of the printer head and other sensitive parts.  Do not use gasoline, acetone and other organic solvents for printer head cleaning. 66..11 SSaaffeettyy PPrreeccaauuttiioonnss This section presents information intended to ensure safe and effective use of Prompt-iPrinter. Warming:  Scratch Warning: Never try to touch the auto cutter or jagged teeth.  Scald Warning: To avoid being burnt, please do not touch the printer head.  Shock Warning: Please off the power before you Plug/Unplug the power cable from the printer. Cautions: 1. Please apply the power adapter to a stable voltage (230 V), please do not use other devices on the same power outlet to avoid voltage fluctuation. 2. Install the Prompt-IPrinter on a flat and stable surface to avoid printer suffering from any vibration or shocks. 3. If water or other liquid spills into the printer, unplug the power cord immediately and contact your dealer or service center for advice. 4. Disconnect the power cord if the printer is idle for a long time. 5. Please ensure the switch button is “off” before you plug the power cord. 6. Strictly follow the recommended usage tips and instructions mentioned in this manual.
