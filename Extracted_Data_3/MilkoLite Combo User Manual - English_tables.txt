Table 4:
	
Plug in MilkoLite Combo power cable into Mains supply board and “ON” Power switch.	Once power of MilkoLite Combo is ON, Display will show MILK MILKOLITE COMBO.
	
Next FAT, SNF AND ADDED WATER TEST shows on display.	Next, version number shows on display.
	
Next, MACHINE ID will appear on MilkoLite Combo display.	After, you will see WARM UP message. It may take up to a minute.
	
Then CLEANING CYCLES message appears on display, here user need to clean MilkoLite Combo (with water) with minimum 025 cycles.	After successfully start-up cleaning, “CLEANING OVER” shows on display. Now, your milk MilkoLite Combo is ready to work.

Table 5:
	
Take the 40ml sample bottle given along with the MilkoLite Combo and take at least 35ml Milk in bottle.	An Ultrasonic stirrer is inbuilt with the MilkoLite Combo. 
Take the milk sample bottle and put it in the stirrer. There should be minimum 10 seconds stirring time for the sample.
Afterwards, Press OK button.

Table 6:
	
Take the milk in the milk sample bottle, put it under the pipette of MilkoLite Combo and Press OK button. Milk will be absorbed from the pipette.	After pressing OK, the machine will start the milk analysis of the sample. You will see WORKING… message on screen with blocks showing progress.
	
The result will show the FAT%, SNF%, Added Water% and Density of the milk. This is your desired result. If a DPU or computer system connected with the MilkoLite Combo, the readings will be transferred there automatically.	
NOTE: Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw milk sample from the farmer and measure the FAT again.	NOTE: Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw milk sample from the farmer and measure the FAT again.

Table 7:
	
Take the clean water in sample bottle.	Put the sample bottle below the pipette of MilkoLite Combo, and press the OK button. 
	
The result should come like:
FAT %: 0.00 | SNF %: 0.00 | 
Added Water %: 100 | Density: 0.00	

Table 8:
	
Take Clean Water / Mineral Water / RO Water in Sample Bottle and put sample bottle under the Pipette of MilkoLite Combo.	Press CLEAN button and 25 cleaning cycles will be seen. You can increase or decrease the cleaning cycle using ▼ and ▲ button. Then press OK button.
	
After staring of first cleaning cycle, REMAINING CYCLES will appear on display.	After finishing, you will receive the CLEANING OVER message.

Table 9:
 	
The sample bottle is of 40ml. Fill the sample bottle with approx. 38ml clean water.
Take 2 ml (Approx. 15 to 20 drops) of Daily Cleaner, in the sample bottle.	This will make a mixture of 5% cleaning solution and 95% of water.
Now the solution is ready for cleaning.
Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity. It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite Combo.	Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity. It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite Combo.

Now put this sample bottle below the pipette of MilkoLite Combo & press CLEAN button.	You can increase or decrease cycles by using ▼ and ▲ button. Press on OK button to start cleaning process.

Table 11:
  	
The sample bottle is of 40ml. Fill the sample bottle with approx. 36ml clean water.
Take 4 ml (Approx. 25 to 30 drops) of Monthly/Power Cleaner in the sample bottle.	This will make a mixture of 10% cleaning solution and 90% of water.
Now the Cleaning solution is ready for cleaning.
Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity.  It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite Combo.	Warning: Do not use the cleaning solution more than recommended quantity.  It is hazardous to the parts of the MilkoLite Combo.

Now put this sample bottle below the pipette of MilkoLite Combo & press CLEAN button.	You can increase or decrease cycles by using ▼ and ▲ button. Press on OK button to start cleaning process.

Table 13:
		
After cleaning is done with Daily Cleaner, Turn off the supply of MilkoLite Combo and remove the Rubber Plug from top of the MilkoLite Combo.	Now, take the plunger which is given in the accessories box and stuck it in the hole on the top.	Now as shown in the image, keep pressing the plunger down forcefully.
		
Now take clean water in sample bottle and put it under the pipette.	Now as shown in the image, keep pressing the plunger up and down. Repeat this process 15-20 times. Remove the bottle when cleaning water comes out from the pipette.	Again keep pressing the plunger slowly up and down, so there is no water in MilkoLite Combo. 
Attach the rubber plug back on the top.
