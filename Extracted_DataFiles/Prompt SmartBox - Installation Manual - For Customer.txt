LTD. The manual will include the Installation, Calibration and Maintenance of the Prompt SmartBox. Prompt SmartBox is designed to monitor Bulk Milk Coolers (BMC) to keep track of Milk Quantity, Temperature, Compressor, and Agitator status. Any deviation observed will notify the server through its GSM connectivity. To monitor the data we have created a special web portal. This portal will be given to each client after the installation of the smart box on site. There would be different types of users who will be using the SmartBox and according to the rights, user will be able to see the reports.

Any deviation observed will notify the server through its GSM connectivity. HOW IT WORKS? We interface with other devices like agitator, compressor, generator, etc., and set the parameters to monitor in our system. Any deviation observed by our system will send alert to the server through its GSM connectivity. To measure the milk quantity in the tank we use highly advanced laser beam technology to attain highest level of accuracy. 1.1 Benefits Quantity of Milk The BMC software captures an exact amount of milk stored in the BMC and tracks changes in case of contamination and spillage of milk. Temperature of BMC The BMC monitoring system monitors the accurate temperature in BMC to prevent curdling, souring and spoiling of milk while preserving proper quality. Cleaning-in-process (CIP) Status Hot water CIP is automatically detected. The maximum temperature for hot water and CIP duration is logged. Generator/Power Grid on Status Monitor power supply through a generator or power grid to regulate temperature and quantity of milk in BMC even in the case of power failure. Multiple Agitator Status This feature helps in avoiding icing of milk as agitator rotates continuously in BMC while maintaining a suitable temperature of the milk. Multiple Compressors Status The BMC Smart Box generates proper and required temperature in BMC to retain desired milk quality over a more extended period Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 3 Prompt SmartBox – Service Manual 1.2 Features that Matter Accuracy  For Temperature Sensor: PT100, Accuracy: ± 1°C, Range: 0°C to 70°C  For Level Measurement: ± 3 mm Accuracy Security  Secure data transfer using AES 256 bit Encryption  Role-based user login in device and web application Data Monitoring Any time data access through Dashboards, Live BMC monitoring, Route wise Live BMC Monitoring, Android application, SMS Alerts and Email alerts Data Transfer  Through Pen drive for which USB port is available in system  Through GSM/GPRS to a remote server. Dispatch During dispatch, dispatch details like Actual Quantity, Dispatch Quantity, Remaining Quantity, Temperature, ON duration of different compressors and Agitators, Generator ON Duration are logged and sync with server.
