Use dry cleaning if the udder is clean. If it is so dirty that wet cleaning is required make sure you wipe the teat dry after cleaning. Use disposable cloths for each cow or individual cloths that are cleaned in a washing machine between every milking.  Treated and sick cows shall always be milked separately and after all the healthy cows.  Pre-milk by hand in a test cup. Take a few squirts from each teat and check for flocculation or blood.  Take off the unit when the milk flow has ceased or is very low. Check that the udder is empty before you remove the unit.  Sufficient and good quality water is required to achieve a satisfactory cleaning result. Page | 8 Milking Machine Service Manual 2) Installation 2.1 Machine Parts Milking Machine made up of several parts: The Pulsator The Pulsator speeds are 60/minute. The pulsator ratios equal to 60/40 are typically ratios. The first number refers to the amount of time the pulsator draws a vacuum to open the liner and withdraw milk. The second number indicates the amount of time it admits atmospheric air to collapse the liner and massage the teat. A 60/40 ratio milks cows faster than a 50/50 ratio. Pulsators have pulsation rates ranging from 45 to 65 cycles per minute. Claw The Milk Claw is an important part of Clusters, which attached to the cow or buffalo etc., consists of four teat cup assemblies (each having a milk shell, a rubber liner and a short pulse tube), a Claw a long milk tube and a long pulse tube. The milking clusters can be available with vacuum shut-off valves with a switch. A transparent cover makes it easy to follow the milk flow and view the milk. A rubber bumper reduces the risk of breakage if the claw drops. Cluster Set The cluster set is made of the following component.  Claw  Liners  Teat Cup  Small Plus tube Page | 9 Milking Machine Service Manual Teat Cup Material: stainless steel 304 Excellent quality, Suitable for different cow milking liners With high gloss polished stainless steel material Sufficient thickness of teat cup shell to protect the milking liners. Liners Liners are the only component of the milking machine that come into close contact with animal teats, Liners need to carefully select your target herd and machinery, and changed regularly. The liner helps promote teat health by providing exceptional relief to the teat skin and teat-end.  Elasticity and softness, Maximum hygiene, Long-lasting.  Change them after 2500 milking. Vacuum Pump Heart of the system Generates the vacuum that:  Removes the milk  Massages the teat  Moves the milk Vacuum Gauge The vacuum gauge indicates the level of vacuum in the system. It should be placed in a visible location so the level of vacuum can be checked regularly during milking. Vacuum Controller The vacuum level of -40kpa to -50kpa are mostly used for cow and buffalo -50kpa to -55kpa. Milk Tube PVC material, no smell, non-toxic material, Made from food-grade material. Long and reliable shelf life, Transparent and lightweight, Smooth inner and outer surface. Extremely resistant to fat, water, detergents and atmospheric agents. Maximum reliability and high performance Must be a change in 1 year.
