PROMPT INNOVATIONS PVT. LTD. QR/DGN/08 00 Installation SOP MilkoChill (3 parts assembly) PROMPT INNOVATIONS PVT. LTD. QR/DGN/08 00 Assemble Procedure 1. Unbox the system from wooden packing box. Ensure that there is no physical damage in the system. 2. Put main structure of MilkoChill (HRU+Ref unit) on the designated installation place and check leveling by spirit level. Legs can be adjusted to achieve flat level. 3. Put cooling unit on main structure and fit it with the L-clamp provided at the back side of main structure. 4. Pass RTD wiring of cooling unit from the rubber gasket provided in the top plate of main structure. Insert provided sleeve over RTD wires. 5. Fit electrical panel by 4 Allen bolts and nuts. Connect all RTDs (8 nos.) to main card. 6. Connect mains cable & compressor wire to terminal block as per given label. Connect two condenser fan wires to respective Dotech connections. 7. Disconnect wire from A1 connection of contactor. 8. Connect battery wire to main card. Display will start. 9. In live parameter menu, check that no RTD is showing ‘OPEN’. 10. Fit copper union of 3/8” and 1/2” with cooling unit inlet and outlet respectively. 11. Connect L.P. and H.P. capillary flares with the respective Dotech L.P and H.P. connection. 12. Turn on main supply and MCB. Energymeter , dotech switch , display will turn ON and AC mains LED will glow. 13. Now release some amount of refrigerant from condenser by slight opening of condenser outlet service valve till the Dotech shows 0.10 MPa and then close the valve. Check all 4 connections. In case of leakage, tight it until leakage stop. 14. Check all flare connections of refrigeration unit with soap solution and ensure that all joints are leakproof. 15. Start vacuum from compressor process port & H.P. service valve/NRV at outlet of HRU and do it for 2-3 hours. Ensure that before turning OFF the vacuum pump, Dotech (L.P. & H.P.) reading must be -0.10 /0.09 MPa. 16. Now release refrigerant from condenser by opening service valve of condenser outlet. 17. Fill the water in HRU (~120 ltr) & Cooling unit (~155 ltr). PROMPT INNOVATIONS PVT. LTD. QR/DGN/08 00 18. Change Dotech setting (LPS: 0.1 MPa) and check other setting as per annexure 1. 19. Now turn OFF the MCB. Connect wire to A1 connection of the contactor. 20. Turn ON the MCB. After 3 min compressor will start automatically. 21. When compressor is ON, check power (0.7-1.3 kW), current (3.7-5.3 A) and voltage (230±5%) from energy meter. 22. Top up the refrigerant from the compressor process port into the system as per requirement. 23. When Dotech L.P. value exceeds 0.30 MPa, change LPS setting to 0.25 MPa. 24. Wash the funnel with clean water and wet cloth. Flush the cooling unit with 5 liters clean water and clean the collector before attaching. 25. System is now under charging cycle. LED of compressor and mains must be glowing. 26. Fit all M.S. cover in place. PROMPT INNOVATIONS PVT. LTD.
