Introduction Prompt has leveraged the RFID and GPS technology and developed a solution TankAssure - Automatic Milk Sampler System which can be installed on milk tankers, which will enable automatic sampling and measurement of the quantity of milk from various milk collection points. TankAssure is a closed, containerized and digitally password protected system which consists of 15 sampling pumps, and RFID tagged tamper-proof sample vials. It comes in the form of a box mounted on the tanker and functions to automatically collect BMC milk samples and record Qty. and temperature. It can measure temperature and Qty. of milk collected from BMC with the help of a magnetic flow meter having an in-built temperature sensor. Automatically Data Sync into Server Society Code, Society name, Quantity, Temperature, Dispatch Start time, Dispatch End time, and RFID ID sync to the server automatically when tanker returns from the route. Route Data In Route data following parameters are available: Route Code, Route Qty, Route Start time, Route End time. Log History In log history data of Lock status, User1, User2 are available.

Process SOP 2.1 Tanker preparation to leave for Route Step-1: Open the door of TankAssure using your Username and password as instructed below Press the lock icon to enter the Click on the Door Control function on username and password to open the the main menu page. door. 14002162 14002696 1234 1234 Both username and password are given to the authorized persons. Step-2: Open CIP Manual valve P a g e 4 | 9 TankAssure-S15 Process SOP Step-3: Now click on CIP in the main menu and Start the rinse process for a minimum of 15 minutes from the Master tablet. Step-4: Sync Society Data Press the Society Data Sync. Tab and Start Initialize Process Sync the Society Data and wait until all the Society sync. Step-5: Enter Route Number only after successful sync of Society Data Once all society Sync then enter the Route Number Once Route number is entered then Route Enter status appears Green P a g e 5 | 9 TankAssure-S15 Process SOP Step-6: Stop CIP process and Close CIP manual valve Step-7: Insert Rack, Put Ice-Pad and Close the Rack box Put the sample bottle Rack having name prompt on it over the derlin Put the ice pades and lock the rack block proparly and make sure all box. nozzles should be inserted in the bottle holes. When you press the Alarm tab, then it Press the Alarm Tab from the Main will show above screen with the Status Menu screen to view the status of all of each flag. flags. Press the RFID TESTING tab to view status of RFID flags. P a g e 6 | 9 TankAssure-S15 Process SOP After inserting the Rack and ice pad, press the RFID TEST CMD, the status of all RFID Tag appears green. Step-8: Check filter Union (It should be fitted properly otherwise the milk will be leaked from here) Step-9: Close the Door using Password. After all status appears green then ROUTE After closing the door using password START READY also appears green in the status of Door close appears green. above screen. Step-10: A tanker is ready and the route number appears on the main menu page. P a g e 7 | 9 TankAssure-S15 Process SOP 2.2 Tanker receiving Process When the tanker returns from the route and reached Dairy Premises then data of Society Code, Society name, Quantity, Temperature, Dispatch Start time, Dispatch End time, and RFID ID tag will sync to the server automatically. Step-1: Open the TankAssure door from the master tablet using admin1 and admin2 passwords. 14002162 14002696 1234 1234 Step-2: Open physical lock of the door Step-3: Open Rack box and remove the rack Step-4: Check sample Quantity and it to a lab for further testing Step-5: Lock TankAssure door physically Step-6: Now Tanker go for the unloading P a g e 8 | 9 TankAssure-S15 Process SOP 2.3 Tanker CIP Process Step-1: Tanker goes for cleaning - When flow will detect all motors will start to rotate one by one automatically. Step-2: After the cleaning is over, close the main door of TankAssure. Step-3: Tanker will go for parking. After reaching at Parking, switch off the main power of TankAssure. 3. Trouble Shooting 3.1 RFID Complain  Check cables of RFID reader  Check log of previous days data that simulation had done or not  Check Rack position if RFID tag not write  Check mechanism of sample bottle holder. If required then set further. 3.2 Latitude/Longitude Complain  Check the current latitude and longitude with previous day data  If mismatch then update latitude and longitude in society file, Inform plant engineer to sync society in each tankers.  If society comes with unknown code “9998” then check GPS communication status in log file.  If tanker parked under the shade area at the BMC location then the system may collect the collection with Unknown society code 3.3 Empty Sample Complains  Check current day quantity and previous day quantity.  Check motor and cables before route start.  Check the flow meter working condition.  Check Ethernet cable, motors, GPS communication.  Check society sync count at initializing process. 3.4 Less Samples  Check current quantity and previous day quantity.  In case of Unknown society code “9998” found during collection then system will collect the sample with 1000 litre reference. In this case, update the actual latitude and longitude. P a g e 9 | 9 TankAssure-S15 Process SOP
