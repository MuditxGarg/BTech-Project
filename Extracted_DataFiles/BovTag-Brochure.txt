This becomes a big hurdle in establishing a Click image from android device Result does not ensure any authenticity of the data. robust Animal Identiﬁcation System at the farm and Raw image along with result & geo-location will be updated to the cloud Retrain the model to improve accuracy Deploy the model in mobile app In addition to that, the existing solutions for the dairy level. KEY FEATURES O N E S I M P L E A N D S M A R T S O L U T I O N Built on complex algorithms and advanced image processing technologies Date, time and geo-location information recorded from where the data is captured It can read ear tags even if it is scratched, has hair, mud or dirt and of any size, colour and font P R E S E N T I N G Reading of tag is possible from a distance of 1.2 metres (4-feet) using the mobile phone built-in zoom camera Reading of tag in less than 10 seconds The tag can be read even in low lighting (using mobile phone ﬂash), varied camera angle and disturbed tag alignment An affordable, automatic and digitised way of reading ear tags in cattle. Works on online as well as ofﬂine mode Auto-adjusts to ensure better image quality (sharpness) BovTag makes the hectic process of animal Reading of tag is possible with any Android smart-phone device with below mentioned minimal speciﬁcations: identiﬁcation simpler and efﬁcient. It RAM OS Version Camera Processor captures the image of the existing ear tag of the animal and extracts a unique Android 7.0 & above 4 GB & above 8 MP minimum 2GHz minimum identiﬁcation number on it. It records the date, time and geo-location from where the BENEFITS ANIMAL husbandry APPLICATION data is captured to ensure its authenticity. Improves transparency between all stakeholders in the system Acts as an enabler to make cattle identiﬁcation easy, effective & efﬁcient India's ﬁrst and only mobile app-based reader (ﬁled for patent) allows the integration of the unique identiﬁcation number with farm Affordable solution which does not require other expensive tag reading devices Increased accuracy and error-free reading of existing ear tag management software to extract details of the animal, making the process of collecting Can be integrated with any existing farm management or animal management software or application (online only) Due to geo-tagging, authenticity of captured data is ensured and recording data as smooth as possible.
