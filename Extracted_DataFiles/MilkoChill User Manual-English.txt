(Instant Milk Chiller Division) 4) Basic Operations of MilkoChill  Power on the chiller by pressing power ON/OFF switch. You will see the message on display “Status: Not Ready for Milk Chilling”. Chiller will start automatically after delay of 3 min.  Charge bar is the approximate indication of amount of thermal charge available in the system. It has an indication from 0-100%  After 100% charge, the status will change to “Ready for Milk Chilling” and LED of “Ready” will glow. It takes around 6 hours to fully charge the chiller from completely discharged condition.  Chiller is now ready for milk chilling. 250 liters of Milk pouring can be started now.  Around 60 Liters of milk can be poured into funnel at a time. Chilled milk will come out from the collector and it can be collected at collector outlet by placing an empty Milk Can.  During milk pouring the display automatically shows “Milk Chilling in Progress” and also displays the milk outlet temperature.  After the completion of milk pouring, CIP process should be carried out immediately.  Take out hot water from chiller and fill 2 partitions of CIP tank. Fill tap water in 3rd partition of CIP tank.  After necessary CIP setup, insert the CIP plunger into inlet tubes. CIP process consists of 3 cycles: Hot water cycle, NaOH cycle and Flush cycle. Press CIP button to carryout CIP process. CIP process will be completed automatically.  CIP process is now completed.  Chiller will automatically start charging for the next cycle.
