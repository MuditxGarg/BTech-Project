INTRODUCTION 1.1 Product Information The smart milk analyzer analyzes the raw milk and gets the details of the substance like FAT%, SNF%, ADDED WATER% and DENSITY. The smart milk analyzer can be calibrated using Bluetooth and mobile applications. Prompt’s milk analyzer is India’s first technically advanced ultrasonic milk analyzer, which is designed to measure milk FAT-SNF, ADDED WATER, and milk DENSITY. This FAT & SNF testing machine is highly efficacious that renders consistent performance over an extended period with maintaining accuracy and fully protected calibration.

Start Take Milk Analyzer, Stirrer, Bluetooth dongle, Reference samples and Mobile Application 2 times Water Cleaning Login to Settings Menu and Go to Calibration Menu Start the Analysis of Milk Samples one by one Sync Bluetooth dongle and Mobile Application Connect Bluetooth & get Calibration Menus of Analyzer in mobile app Select appropriate Calibration Menu & add reference sample values Apply Calibration as per difference of Reference data and Sample data Analysis one reference sample in Analyzer NO Are Analyzer and reference sample values same? YES sample values same? End Page | 4 iSmart Milk Analyzer – Calibration Manual Document Version 1.2 3 SETUP FOR CALIBRATION For the calibration of the Smart Milk Analyzer, some basic requirements are there which explained below. 3.1 Smart Milk Analyzer This calibration process explained here is for the Smart Milk Analyzer of version 1.2.X.X and onwards. 3.2 Ultrasonic Stirrer The ultrasonic stirrer is part of the Milk Analyzer. The stirrer works on the ultrasonic sound wave principle and makes the milk ready for the Milk Analysis by removing Air bubbles from the Milk. The sample used for the calibration must be applied on the stirrer before being checked in the Analyzer. Page | 5 iSmart Milk Analyzer – Calibration Manual Document Version 1.2 3.3 Milk Samples – Checked by Reference Methods The RAW MILK samples are taken for calibration by the reference methods of Gerber for FAT% and Lactometer for SNF%. For milk sampling the user have to take at least 5 samples of 250ml between a minimum range of FAT & SNF and a maximum range of FAT & SNF. Sample FAT SNF 1 3.0 % - 4.5 % 2 5.0 % - 6.0 % 5 Samples which are having SNF 3 6.5 % - 7.5 % range from 6% to 12% 4 8.0 % - 9.0 % 5 9.0 % - 10.0 % 3.4 Bluetooth Dongle and Mobile Application A Bluetooth dongle is specially Prompt Calib Plus is a special mobile designed to calibrate the Milk application which is made for Analyzer by the mobile application. calibration and is given to be It is given with the Milk Analyzer. installed into the smartphone.

The red font shows the analyzer reading comes less than the reference value and the green one shows the analyzer value is higher than the reference.  All the calculations have been done automatically.  Now press CALCULATE DATA button at the bottom. Page | 13 iSmart Milk Analyzer – Calibration Manual Document Version 1.2  Now this is the final screen for the calibration.  Select a calibration reason first.  This will show the ref machine type 1 and machine id of the analyzer which needs to be calibrated.  Below that, the old Slope FAT-SNF, old intercept FAT and SNF and the Accuracy of FAT and SNF are seen. These values are fetched automatically.  Below, the option will be for S/I; which shows the new Slope FAT and SNF, new Intercept FAT and SNF and Accuracy of FAT and SNF. These values will be calculated automatically.  Recommended SNF slop value should be between 0.75 to 1.35.  You will see the Bias settings below the S/I option.  This is also another calculation method for the calibration.  This will also show the new Slope FAT and SNF, the new Intercept FAT and SNF and the Accuracy of FAT and SNF.  Here as per calculation SNF slop is between the recommended SNF Slop values, so APPLY button is enabled.  Below that, you will see the APPLY button. Press APPLY button. After pressing the button, you will receive a message, which shows the calibration is done successfully. CALIBRATED SUCCESSFULLY Now, close the mobile application and verify the calibration, it is recommended to check a reference sample once again in the analyzer.
