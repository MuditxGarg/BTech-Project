The prompt equipments entered in the dairy industry when AMUL Amul Logistic app offers: sought help for removing the covered malpractices and adulteration in the dairy supply chain. The prompt peeped into the  The Paperless Process that introduced digital working challenges faced by the dairy company and resolved the problem ambience. by developing an AMUL logistics app. The primary goal behind the  It enhanced Data longevity by storing it on the cloud for development of this app was to provide surveillance power to anytime access Amul staff for tracking the data of transportation, milk collection and distance travelled This case study covers an overview of the  It saved many expenses which were involved in AMUL transportation, paperwork and milk collection. About Amul Logistic App: Amul Logistic App is an Android-based app developed to assist digitalized the milk supply chain management format and Milk Union for monitoring milk collection data and milk quality at provided a paperless process by securing all the necessary data union and society level. The primary ambition behind the over the cloud. It turned it as cost saving as it restricted development of this IoT based application was to provide a grip malfunctioning executed at various level. It felicitates the over the management of the dairy supply chain. The app digitizes collection from BMC and Cans both. It provides a dynamic report the monitoring of truck sheets, track transporters' real-time, in a different
format with an export option. The app has enhanced automate data recording, produce dynamic reports, manage truck milk quality. The application is accessible in both online and allocations, store pictures along with data and control data offline mode. The application even highlights the ongoing discrepancies. It also supports offline mode to add truck sheet malfunctioning through colour code alerts in data. It also data at society level including GPS positioning and images. It regulates tanker management irrespective of the number of provides full surveillance on the truck drivers and milk collection plants. to impede malpractices and adulteration. The logistic app has Challenges lodged:  The first and the foremost problem which appeared as the main lead of all the others was the route plan. The drivers hired were observed for adopting the long route which has not only increased the fuel consumption but also degraded the quality of milk. So the first step to be taken was to control transportation cost and format a DCS-wise route plan.  The second problem was the surveillance over the trucks which were allocated for the collection of milk. Beside the path, the acknowledgement format was entirely paper-based, most of the data were inorganic and adulterated. It was tough to keep the records of the drivers and related workers for future purposes. The payment criteria were also affected due to wrong information provided. So it has become indispensable to digitize the whole data system and store it on the cloud for any time access. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Copyright © PROMPT 2019 All Rights Reserved Technology Solution For Bulk Milk Cooler _________________________________________________________________________________  The third issue discovered was about the quality of the milk received at AMUL for production purposes. The Milk collected at the AMUL was of low grade. The reason behind it was the high
temperature of Bulk Milk Cooler. The Dairy Company has asked the Village Dairy Cooperative Society to maintain the temperature of BMC at 4-degree Celsius to increase the shelf life of the milk, but it was not followed by the society which caused low milk quality and sometimes even spoilage of it. The addition of water also appeared in the scene. Whenever asked, the answer was not accurate which created lots of plight and doubts.  The last problem was cleanliness update. It was not an easy task to keep a check over the cleanliness of the tanker. It was assumed that the use of a dirty tank could contribute to the spoilage of milk. The extra consumption of money was also reported for balancing the milk content by removing excess water. How did the AMUL Logistic app fix the Problems? The prompt equipment introduced a new way to improve the milk supply chain and modified the existing system by embracing it with digitalization.  The IoT based software made the whole management system as paperless. The prompt equipment made a web portal and Mobile app. The web portal is to be administered by the Admin, and the mobile app is to be used by Conductors. The new digital system provided full data security and accessibility to Real-Time data availability along with tracking.  The AMUL Logistic App can schedule the route plan automatically as per the Union rule and policies. The Shift wise route planning assures that no bus or conductor repeats the same path and VDS.  The next thing to be focused on was the measurement of the distance travelled. The Amul logistic app provides the image capture option of speedometer without any gallery option. This reflects that one has to click the photo of the odometer before
starting the journey and after completion as well. The app doesn't hold any gallery photo upload option to restrict any kind of wrong practices.  The Amul Logistic web portal generates the report in the SAP format and even data comparison facility. The portal enables the data comparison between the VDCS Collection and tanker Collection.  Well, if any changes are observed in the data compared to the general expected data, the system highlights it with different colour. The dairy company can even customize the colour for different alerts.  Time calculation has become easy, as the app provides a section in which the VDCS staff have to sign on the app approving that the data filled is accurate. The app notes down the entry time and estimates the total time to be taken to complete the milk collection cycle.  The app even asks the staff to click the image of the BMC tank to ensure the cleanliness and also pictures of temperature at which milk has been sustaining.  The logistic app even assisted the staff for managing the tank capacity and its usage as per the requirement to avoid any loss caused by it.  It provided the facility to trace the path followed and luxury to collect milk for BMC and CANS both.  The app also grants Dipstick Chart Option and can work in both online and offline mode.The Positive Upshot ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Copyright © PROMPT 2019 All Rights Reserved Technology Solution For Bulk Milk Cooler _________________________________________________________________________________ The Amul Logistic app was initially part of 50 VDCS, but after its positive result, the company introduced it to 1700 DCS and utilised it to track 300 truck. The App provided detailed information and updated data to calculate the time travelled which disclosed all the wrong practices going
on within the chain. The Dynamic reports are available with different format and export option has reduced the paperwork formalities. Every-Step surveillance has improved the quality of milk and its shelf life. The real-time data availability has also reduced the time consumption by tracking the path followed by the truck driver. Ultimately the AMUL logistic app has successfully achieved the goal and helped in saving excess expenditure caused by mismanagement. The app reduced per tanker transportation cost, per litre cost and human resources cost ensuring more profit to the dairy company. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Copyright © PROMPT 2019 All Rights Reserved

Any deviation observed will notify the server through its GSM connectivity. HOW IT WORKS? We interface with other devices like agitator, compressor, generator, etc., and set the parameters to monitor in our system. Any deviation observed by our system will send alert to the server through its GSM connectivity. To measure the milk quantity in the tank we use highly advanced laser beam technology to attain highest level of accuracy. 1.1 Benefits Quantity of Milk The BMC software captures an exact amount of milk stored in the BMC and tracks changes in case of contamination and spillage of milk. Temperature of BMC The BMC monitoring system monitors the accurate temperature in BMC to prevent curdling, souring and spoiling of milk while preserving proper quality. Cleaning-in-process (CIP) Status Hot water CIP is automatically detected. The maximum temperature for hot water and CIP
duration is logged. Generator/Power Grid on Status Monitor power supply through a generator or power grid to regulate temperature and quantity of milk in BMC even in the case of power failure. Multiple Agitator Status This feature helps in avoiding icing of milk as agitator rotates continuously in BMC while maintaining a suitable temperature of the milk. Multiple Compressors Status The BMC Smart Box generates proper and required temperature in BMC to retain desired milk quality over a more extended period Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 3 BMC smart Box-2 – Service Manual 1.2 Features that Matter Accuracy  For Temperature Sensor: PT100, Accuracy: ± 1°C, Range: 0°C to 70°C  For Level Measurement: ± 3 mm Accuracy Security  Secure data transfer using AES 256 bit Encryption  Role-based user login in device and web application Data Monitoring Any time data access through Dashboards, Live BMC monitoring, Route wise Live BMC Monitoring, Android application, SMS Alerts and Email alerts Data Transfer  Through Pen drive for which USB port is available in system  Through GSM/GPRS to a remote server.

Any deviation observed will notify the server through its GSM connectivity. HOW IT WORKS? We interface with other devices like agitator, compressor, generator, etc., and set the parameters to monitor in our system. Any deviation observed by our system will send alert to the
server through its GSM connectivity. To measure the milk quantity in the tank we use highly advanced laser beam technology to attain highest level of accuracy. 1.1 Benefits Quantity of Milk The BMC software captures an exact amount of milk stored in the BMC and tracks changes in case of contamination and spillage of milk. Temperature of Milk The BMC monitoring system monitors the accurate temperature in BMC to prevent curdling, souring and spoiling of milk while preserving proper quality. Cleaning-in-process (CIP) Status Hot water CIP is automatically detected. The maximum temperature for hot water and CIP duration is logged. Generator/Power Grid on Status Monitor power supply through a generator or power grid to regulate temperature and quantity of milk in BMC even in the case of power failure. Multiple Agitator Status This feature helps in avoiding icing of milk as agitator rotates continuously in BMC while maintaining a suitable temperature of the milk. Multiple Compressor Status The BMC Smart Box generates proper and required temperature in BMC to retain desired milk quality over a more extended period Confidential Data: Do not share without permission Page | 3 1.2 Features Accuracy For Temperature Sensor: PT100, Accuracy: 1°C, Range: 0°C to 70°C For Level Measurement: ±3mm Accuracy Security Secure data transfer using AES 256 bit Encryption Role-based user login in device and web application Data Monitoring Any time data access through Dashboards, Live BMC monitoring, Route wise Live BMC Monitoring, Android application, SMS Alerts and Email alerts Data Transfer Through Pen drive for which USB port is available in system Through GSM to a remote server.

Use dry cleaning if the udder is clean. If it is so dirty that wet cleaning is required make sure you wipe the teat dry after cleaning. Use disposable cloths for each cow or individual
cloths that are cleaned in a washing machine between every milking.  Treated and sick cows shall always be milked separately and after all the healthy cows.  Pre-milk by hand in a test cup. Take a few squirts from each teat and check for flocculation or blood.  Take off the unit when the milk flow has ceased or is very low. Check that the udder is empty before you remove the unit.  Sufficient and good quality water is required to achieve a satisfactory cleaning result. Page | 8 Milking Machine Service Manual 2) Installation 2.1 Machine Parts Milking Machine made up of several parts: The Pulsator The Pulsator speeds are 60/minute. The pulsator ratios equal to 60/40 are typically ratios. The first number refers to the amount of time the pulsator draws a vacuum to open the liner and withdraw milk. The second number indicates the amount of time it admits atmospheric air to collapse the liner and massage the teat. A 60/40 ratio milks cows faster than a 50/50 ratio. Pulsators have pulsation rates ranging from 45 to 65 cycles per minute. Claw The Milk Claw is an important part of Clusters, which attached to the cow or buffalo etc., consists of four teat cup assemblies (each having a milk shell, a rubber liner and a short pulse tube), a Claw a long milk tube and a long pulse tube. The milking clusters can be available with vacuum shut-off valves with a switch. A transparent cover makes it easy to follow the milk flow and view the milk. A rubber bumper reduces the risk of breakage if the claw drops. Cluster Set The cluster set is made of the following component.  Claw  Liners  Teat Cup  Small Plus tube Page | 9 Milking
Machine Service Manual Teat Cup Material: stainless steel 304 Excellent quality, Suitable for different cow milking liners With high gloss polished stainless steel material Sufficient thickness of teat cup shell to protect the milking liners. Liners Liners are the only component of the milking machine that come into close contact with animal teats, Liners need to carefully select your target herd and machinery, and changed regularly. The liner helps promote teat health by providing exceptional relief to the teat skin and teat-end.  Elasticity and softness, Maximum hygiene, Long-lasting.  Change them after 2500 milking. Vacuum Pump Heart of the system Generates the vacuum that:  Removes the milk  Massages the teat  Moves the milk Vacuum Gauge The vacuum gauge indicates the level of vacuum in the system. It should be placed in a visible location so the level of vacuum can be checked regularly during milking. Vacuum Controller The vacuum level of -40kpa to -50kpa are mostly used for cow and buffalo -50kpa to -55kpa. Milk Tube PVC material, no smell, non-toxic material, Made from food-grade material. Long and reliable shelf life, Transparent and lightweight, Smooth inner and outer surface. Extremely resistant to fat, water, detergents and atmospheric agents. Maximum reliability and high performance Must be a change in 1 year.

The pulsator
ratios equal to 60/40 are typically ratios. The first number refers to the amount of time the pulsator draws a vacuum to open the liner and withdraw milk. The second number indicates the amount of time it admits atmospheric air to collapse the liner and massage the teat. A 60/40 ratio milks cows faster than a 50/50 ratio. Pulsators have pulsation rates ranging from 45 to 65 cycles per minute. Claw The Milk Claw is an important part of Clusters, which attached to the cow or buffalo etc., consists of four teat cup assemblies (each having a milk shell, a rubber liner and a short pulse tube), a Claw a long milk tube and a long pulse tube. The milking clusters can be available with vacuum shut-off valves with a switch. A transparent cover makes it easy to follow the milk flow and view the milk. A rubber bumper reduces the risk of breakage if the claw drops. Cluster Set The cluster set is made of the following component.  Claw  Liners  Teat Cup  Small Plus tube Milking Machine User Manual Page | 8 Teat Cup Material: stainless steel 304 Excellent quality, Suitable for different cow milking liners With high gloss polished stainless steel material Sufficient thickness of teat cup shell to protect the milking liners. Liners Liners are the only component of the milking machine that come into close contact with animal teats, Liners need to carefully select your target herd and machinery, and changed regularly. The liner helps promote teat health by providing exceptional relief to the teat skin and teat-end.  Elasticity and softness, Maximum hygiene, Long-lasting.  Change them after 2500 milking. Vacuum Pump Heart of the system Generates the vacuum that:  Removes the milk  Massages the teat  Moves the
milk Vacuum Gauge The vacuum gauge indicates the level of vacuum in the system. It should be placed in a visible location so the level of vacuum can be checked regularly during milking. Vacuum Controller The vacuum level of -40kpa to -50kpa are mostly used for cow and buffalo -50kpa to -55kpa. Milk Tube PVC material, no smell, non-toxic material, Made from food-grade material. Long and reliable shelf life, Transparent and lightweight, smooth inner and outer surface. Extremely resistant to fat, water, detergents and atmospheric agents. Maximum reliability and high performance must be a change in 1 year. Milking Machine User Manual Page | 9 Milking Machine User Manual Page | 10 Milking Machine User Manual Page | 11 3) Cleaning Procedure The milk from a healthy animal is almost sterile when it leaves the udder. To maintain a high quality of the milk it has to be handled in a clean installation. It is, therefore, necessary to clean the milking machine thoroughly after milking.  Sufficient and good quality water is required to achieve a satisfactory cleaning result.  An efficient wash-up routine will help maintain milk quality and also improves the life of milking equipment. • Alkaline chemicals remove fats and protein Cleaning Procedure The efficiency of circulation cleaning depends on the temperature of the water used for the Alkaline chemical solution wash, the optimum initial temperature being at least 85°C. 3.1 Daily Cleaning Circulation cleaning is a two-stage process consisting of a rinse with hot water and a final normal clean water rinse. First, clean the Milk tube and liners with a brush and then clean the machine with the given cleaning steps.

Any deviation observed will notify the server through its GSM connectivity. HOW IT WORKS? We interface with other devices like agitator, compressor, generator, etc., and set the parameters to monitor in our system. Any deviation observed by our system will send alert to the server through its GSM connectivity. To measure the milk quantity in the tank we use highly advanced laser beam technology to attain highest level of accuracy. 1.1 Benefits Quantity of Milk The BMC software captures an exact amount of milk stored in the BMC and tracks changes in case of contamination and spillage of milk. Temperature of BMC The BMC monitoring system monitors the accurate temperature in BMC to prevent curdling, souring and spoiling of milk while preserving proper quality. Cleaning-in-process (CIP) Status Hot water CIP is automatically detected. The maximum temperature for hot water and CIP duration is logged. Generator/Power Grid on Status Monitor power supply through a generator or power grid to regulate temperature and quantity of milk in BMC even in the case of power failure. Multiple Agitator Status This feature helps in avoiding icing of milk as agitator rotates continuously in BMC while maintaining a suitable temperature of the milk. Multiple Compressors Status The BMC Smart Box generates proper and required temperature in BMC to retain desired milk quality over a more extended period

INTRODUCTION 11..11 OObbjjeeccttiivvee To provide an intelligent printing interface to any RS232 output capable device to enable data recording and analytics. 11..22 W Whhaatt iitt DDooeess?? The system provides an intelligent Printing interface to any device giving RS232 output to enable data recording and analytics apart from generating print output. The system intefaces with such a device and stores the data before printing the same. The intelligent printer works as any other Thermal Printer apart from capturing and storing all data. 11..33 AAbboouutt PPrroodduucctt The aim of the device is to get data from machine, store data to the SD card, send and receive data via Bluetooth, and print the data on Prompt-iPrinter. However, the above functionality can be configured to modify or change the device operation as per requirement. Prompt-iPrinter is a cost effective solution to get all the sample result on web through a low cost iPrinter. Prompt-iPrinter prints more quietly and usually faster than impact dot matrix printers. They are also compact in size, lighter in weight and consume less power, making them ideal for portable and custom applications. There will be a provision of extra serial port that can be used to send machine data to PC through RS232 cable. This Prompt-iPrinter is highly efficacious and renders consistent performance over an extended period of time maintaining high level of accuracy. Page 3 Prompt-iPrinter – User Manual

1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 About Product Prompt Sanchay, is an indigenous milk testing machine that combines three essential requirements: stirring, milk slip printing and analyzing milk parameters such as Fat, SNF, added water, and milk density. It is robust, easy to operate, and useful for analyzing cow, buffalo, and mixed milk. The Sanchay analyzes the raw milk and gets the substances details like FAT%, SNF%, ADDED WATER%, and DENSITY. Also able to provide Protein, Lactose and Salt. Calibration of Sanchay can be done through Mobile Application as well as manual. Prompt’s Sanchay is highly efficacious that renders consistent performance over an extended period with maintaining accuracy and fully protected calibration. 1.2 Things to Remember for Sanchay Keep the Sanchay machine in a clean and tidy place. Sanchay can be operated with 230 volt AC OR 12 volt DC. Mineral water, RO water or Distilled water can be used to clean the Sanchay. Take 30ml to 35ml milk in sample bottle. In a Sanchay, filter the milk sample before testing the milk. The temperature of milk should be less than 40oC, if the temperature is more than 40oC then there will be error of “Error-2 HOT / NO SAMPLE” in the machine. Before analysis of milk sample in a Sanchay, Stir the milk and then analyze the milk so air bubbles will remove from the RAW milk. Stir the milk for 15 second if the temperature of milk is less than 15oC and Stir the milk for 10 second if the temperature of milk is greater than 15oC. Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw sample of milk from the farmer and analyze again. Clean the machine two or three times with clean water before starting milk collection and also
with clean water three times after the milk collection is completed. After the collection is completed in each shift, prepare a mixture of Daily Cleaner 5% and Water 95% and clean Sanchay, then clean 15-20 times with the same solution using a plunger. After the every 15 days, prepare a mixture of Power/Monthly Cleaner 10% and Water 90% and clean Sanchay. Clean the Sanchay with a plunger and water if supply is gone out while analyzing a milk sample. After collection of milk and final cleaning, take water in the beaker and load it in the Sanchay so that no waste or germs can go inside the Sanchay. 1.3 Technical Specification of Sanchay 1.4 Parameter Settings for Interfacing of Computer with Sanchay Milk Sample data is single or continuously transmit as per Following string Details, String is made by ASCII format. And 31 characters are there in ASCII format string. TOTAL STRING: (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) HERE ST STRING = ( ENDING STRING = ) XXXX are string data, and total 29 characters are as under, 1ST Character to 4TH Character = FAT DATA 5TH Character to 8TH Character = SNF DATA 9TH Character to 12TH Character = DENSITY DATA 13TH Character to 16TH Character = ADDED WATER DATA 17TH Character to 29TH Character = CORRECTION DATA (For our machine it is always 0) FOR EXAMPLE, FAT= 8.25, SNF = 9.54, DENSITY = 28.57 AND ADDED WATER = 06 % then string is as under (08250954285706000000000000000). 1.5 Accessories Box of Sanchay 2 SANCHAY PHYSICAL STRUCTURE 2.1 Front Panel The front panel will show the screen and four buttons.

| P a g e iSmart Milk Analyzer - User Manual 1.2 Things to Remember During the Installation Process of Smart Milk Analyzer  Keep the Smart Milk Analyzer machine in a clean and tidy place.  Smart Milk Analyzer can be operated with 230 volt AC OR 12 volt DC. If the voltage of AC supply is not stable (between 180 Volts to 260 Volts) then use stabilizer or UPS.  Mineral water, RO water or Distilled water can be used to clean the Smart Milk Analyzer.  Add 35ml milk in sample bottle.  In a Smart Milk Analyzer, filter the milk sample before testing the milk FAT.  The temperature of milk should be less than 40oC, if the temperature is more than 40oC then there will be error of “Error-2 HOT / NO SAMPLE” in the machine.  Before measuring the FAT of milk sample in a Smart Milk Analyzer, Stir the milk and then measure the FAT so air bubbles will remove from the RAW milk. Stir the milk for 15 second if the temperature of milk sample is less than 15oC and Stir the milk for 10 second if the temperature of milk sample is greater than 15oC.  Do not test the same sample repeatedly. If you want to re-test the same sample, take a fresh raw sample of milk from the farmer and measure the FAT again.  Clean the machine two or three times with clean water before starting milk collection and also with clean water three times after the milk collection is completed.  After the collection is completed in each shift, prepare a mixture of Daily Cleaner 5% and Water 95% and clean Smart Milk Analyzer, then clean 15-20 times with the same solution using a plunger.  After
the every 15 days, prepare a mixture of Power/Monthly Cleaner 10% and Water 90% and clean Smart Milk Analyzer.  Clean the Smart Milk Analyzer with a plunger and water if supply is gone out while measuring FAT.  After collection of milk and final cleaning, take water in the beaker and load it in the Smart Milk Analyzer so that no waste or germs can go inside the Smart Milk Analyzer. 3 | P a g e iSmart Milk Analyzer - User Manual 1.3 Technical Specification of Smart Milk Analyzer (Option 1) AC mains Power Supply 230 Volt ± 15 – 20 % 0.4 Amp.

User Manual 1. Introduction Prompt has leveraged the RFID and GPS technology and developed a solution TankAssure -Automatic Milk Sampler System which can be installed on milk tankers, which will enable automatic sampling and measurement of the quantity of milk from various milk collection points. TankAssure is a closed, containerized and digitally password protected system which consists of 7 sampling pumps, and RFID tagged tamper-proof sample vials. It comes in the form of a box mounted on the tanker and functions to automatically collect BMC milk samples and record Qty. and temperature. It can measure temperature and Qty. of milk collected from BMC with the help of a magnetic flow meter having an in-built temperature sensor. Automatically Data Sync into Logistic App Society Code, Society name, Quantity, Temp., Dispatch Start time, Dispatch End time, and RFID ID sync to the server automatically when tanker returns from the route. Route Data In Route data following parameters are available: Route Code, Route Qty, Route Start time, Route End time. Log History In log history data of Lock status, User1, User2 are available. 1.1 Highlights of TankAssure The entire system is electronically locked (password protected) and can be opened only at the dairy plant through authorized persons. The bottles and frame are mounted in an insulated enclosure to ensure that the temperature of the milk sample collected is maintained and does not deteriorate before it reaches the main dairy. The milk collection point details are recorded based on the GPS location of the vehicle. The system can be configured to start/stop operations at the targeted location only. Based on the location, an RFID tag is written on the bottle which can be read at the main dairy through an RFID Reader. The tag identifies the location and collection details from which the sample
has been collected. The entire operation is controlled by a web-based application system operated through a Tablet device. The data can be transferred to the central system at the dairy for further analysis & evaluation. Prompt Logistics App can be integrated with this system for route management. 1.2 Technical Specifications 2. Safety Unsafe practices and other important information are emphasized in this manual.

CURRENT CHALLENGES Accurate recording of the quantity and quality of milk samples collected at milk collection points is essential. Currently, milk quantity is measured manually through dipstick reading and milk sampling is done manually. The sample taken from the milk collection point is not secured and prone to manipulation. The temperature of the milk transferred to milk tanker is not measured. The data of composite milk sample is also not taken into consideration. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, Prompt has uniquely developed TankAssure, an intelligent and digital system which automatically samples milk from milk collection point. PRESENTING An automatic milk sampling system, with GPS, Wi-Fi and RFID technology TankAssure is an electro-mechanical, intelligent box mounted behind the milk tanker. It is a closed, containerised and digitally password-protected secured system that consists of sampling pumps, and RFID-tagged tamper-proof sample vials. It automatically collects the milk sample of milk collection point, measures the milk quantity and temperature with the help of an in-built magnetic ﬂow meter equipped with a temperature sensor. KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SYSTEM Enables secured and automatic sampling of composite milk samples of various milk collection points. The entire operation is controlled by a web-based portal accessed through a tablet device. The milk quantity and temperature data of each milk collection point is transferred to a central portal which can be used by the dairy for further business analysis. It can be integrated with any route management app and automatic milk collection system. The system can log the location and time stamp data from where milk transfer starts and stop. Only authorised personnel can open the electronically protected door at the dairy.
