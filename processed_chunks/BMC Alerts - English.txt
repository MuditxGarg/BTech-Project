[CLS] b ##mc monitoring system alert ##s 1 ) main ##s off : when the electrical grid supply is cut off then the b ##mc monitoring system will check for 10 minutes and then if the supply doesn â€™ t come then sends an alert . between 10 to 120 minutes , if the electrical grid supply comes back then update the status on the web portal only . after 120 minutes if the electrical grid supply is not available then again send an alert . 2 ) high temperature : in settings , the user can set b ##mc wise milk reception timing , session / shift start and end timing , and define the tank wise cooling time . after the cooling time , if the system sense more than 8 ##oc temperature and at the same time tank is not empty then sends an alert . after 120 minutes , the b ##mc monitoring system rec ##he ##cks the temperature and if it is more than 8 ##oc then again sends an alert . 3 ) compressor off : once the b ##mc tank achieve ##s 4 ##oc temperature and then increases to 5 ##oc and at that time if the compressor is not powered on then the system sends an alert . after 120 minutes , the b ##mc monitoring system rec ##he ##cks the temperature and if it is 5 ##oc or more and that time compressor is not powered on then again sends an alert . 4 ) dispatch : if at least 15 % quantity is out of available quantity from b ##mc tank then b ##mc monitoring system considers as dispatch . b ##mc monitoring system alert ##s 1 | p a g e 5 ) ci ##p : ci ##p should be completed within 6 hours of dispatch . at the time of ci ##p , the temperature should be 20 ##oc or more than only the b ##mc monitoring system considers ci ##p start . within 10 minutes , a minimum 2 ##oc temperature should increase , and temperature should not decrease 4 ##oc from higher temperature . if all the above parameters match then the b ##mc monitoring system considers ci ##p done . within 10 minutes , a minimum 2 ##oc temperature is not increased , or if the temperature decreases by 4 ##oc from a higher temperature then the b ##mc monitoring system considers ci ##p pending . 6 ) over chilling : once the b ##mc tank achieve ##s 4 ##oc temperature and then temperature goes below 3 ##oc then the b ##mc monitoring system considers over chilling and sends an alert . after 120 minutes , the b ##mc monitoring system rec ##he ##cks the temperature and if it is below 3 ##oc then again sends an alert . b ##mc monitoring system alert ##s 2 | p a g e [SEP]
