[CLS] prompt smart ##box cal ##ib ##ration external structure smart ##box is a hardware device which will look like shown below . the below image is showing the structure of the b ##mc smart box . smart box top view the side view of the b ##mc smart box installation installation of b ##mc monitoring system can be decided after the completing survey . after the necessary changes at the site , b ##mc monitoring system can be install . the installation of the b ##mc smart box will be done by following the steps given below : material check list configuration on server cal ##ib ##ration temperature cal ##ib ##ration pressure cal ##ib ##ration linear cal ##ib ##ration sim card change gs ##m module change we are going to see each and every stages one by one here . smart box installation steps contact local electric ##ian and complete wiring for ac main , generator , compressor and ag ##ita ##tor sensing . ac main detection can be done directly from before mc ##b or other switch they are using to off main ##s supply . check the system there and connect with ac power supply . install rt ##d near to tank panel rt ##d . install pressure sensor when tank is empty mount b ##mc smart box on wall through screw where proper visibility of lcd and operation . connect ac main ##s , generator , ag ##ita ##tor , compressor , rt ##d and pressure sensor . cal ##ib ##ration process cal ##ib ##ration is most important after installing the system properly . we are going to make the cal ##ib ##ration on three different stages . start - up log ##in process : press ci ##p and di ##s switches simultaneously after the power on , then system will go to cal ##ib ##ration mode . system will ask for password . enter password “ 147 ” . it has total f1 to f ##4 menu f1 : temperature cal ##ib ##ration f ##2 : pressure cal ##ib ##ration f ##3 : date & time f ##4 : media f1 : temperature cal ##ib ##ration temperature cal ##ib ##ration is done to know the real temperature of tank . temperature difference of b ##mc tank and b ##mc smart box is less than 10 ##c is per ##missible as per acceptable margin of error . temperature cal ##ib ##ration is mandatory if the difference is more than 10 ##c between b ##mc tank and b ##mc smart box . cal ##ib ##ration process is explained as below . press the en ##t button on the key ##pad and enter the user ##name and password . go to cal ##ib ##ration setting and press the en ##t button and select the temperature cal ##ib ##ration . now clear the temperature cal ##ib ##ration . now compare the reading of b ##mc tank and b ##mc smart box . for comparison follow the below table . maintain at least 150 ##c difference in temperature reading ( for example [SEP]
