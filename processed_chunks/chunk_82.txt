[CLS] procedure : switch on / off . power on smart electronic scale display will show level of battery , voltage , date & time , and device id . run the application and connect it to the scale ’ s blue ##tooth . if the scale ' s blue ##tooth is not connected with the application , the scale will display ' b ##le - of ' message . the weighing scale is ready to use . place a weight on the machine . if you don ' t want to measure weight along with the container , press the tar ##e key to display only the weight of the content . to transfer data , check gps connectivity first . if it is on , press send key and your data will be transferred successfully . the gps led will show a signal error message if it is not on . press the data send key to transfer data if the weight is to be done once only . for multiple measurements , press m + , place the second container on the scale , and follow the same procedure . mr key is used to display the total saved weight . while transferring data , the scale will display the total weight along with send message . mc is used to clear the total saved weight or the last measured weight before placing the next weight . indications : battery level - 15 hours backup where each led shows a 33 % level of battery battery charging - the battery charging led is on when an adapt ##er is connected low battery - low led is on when the battery is down . you need to connect an adapt ##er to charge the battery gps - gps led is on when a device is connected to gps stable weight - stable led is on when weight is stable zero weight - zero led is on when there is no weight on scale negative weight error - there should be a positive weight on the scale . if it is negative , and you press send key or m + key , it will display an error message “ ne ##g - w ##t ” signal error - if there is no gps connectivity and you press send key , it will display the signal error message “ sg - er ##r ” [SEP]
