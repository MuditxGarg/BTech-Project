[CLS] process flow for tank ##ass ##ure s ##7 1 . introduction prompt has leverage ##d the rf ##id and gps technology and developed a solution tank ##ass ##ure - automatic milk sample ##r system which can be installed on milk tanker ##s , which will enable automatic sampling and measurement of the quantity of milk from various milk collection points . tank ##ass ##ure is a closed , container ##ized and digitally password protected system which consists of 7 sampling pumps , and rf ##id tagged tam ##per - proof sample vial ##s . it comes in the form of a box mounted on the tanker and functions to automatically collect b ##mc milk samples and record q ##ty . and temperature . it can measure temperature and q ##ty . of milk collected from b ##mc with the help of a magnetic flow meter having an in - built temperature sensor . automatically data sync into server society code , society name , quantity , te ##mp . , dispatch start time , dispatch end time , and rf ##id id sync to the server automatically when tanker returns from the route . route data in route data following parameters are available : route code , route q ##ty , route start time , route end time . log history in log history data of lock status , user ##1 , user ##2 are available . 2 . process so ##p 2 . 1 tanker preparation to leave for route open the door of tank ##ass ##ure using your user ##name and password as instructed below open ci ##p manual valve now click on ri ##nse ( ci ##p ) in the main menu and start the ri ##nse process for a minimum of 15 minutes from the master tablet . sync total society enter route number stop ci ##p process and close ci ##p manual valve check filter union ( it should be fitted properly otherwise the milk will be leaked from here ) insert rack , put ice - pad and close the rack box close the door using password . a tanker is ready and the route number appears on the main menu page . 2 . 2 tanker receiving process when the tanker returns from the route and reached dairy premises then data of society code , society name , quantity , temperature , dispatch start time , dispatch end time , and rf ##id id tag will sync to the server automatically . open the tank ##ass ##ure door from the master tablet using ad ##min ##1 and ad ##min ##2 password ##s . open physical lock of the door open rack box and remove the rack check sample quantity and it to a lab for further testing lock tank ##ass ##ure door physically now tanker go for the un ##loading 2 . 3 tanker ci ##p process tanker goes for cleaning - when flow will detect all motors will start to rotate one by one after the cleaning is over , lock the [SEP]
