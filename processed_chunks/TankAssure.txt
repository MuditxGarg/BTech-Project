[CLS] current challenges accurate recording of the quantity and quality of milk samples collected at milk collection points is essential . currently , milk quantity is measured manually through dip ##stick reading and milk sampling is done manually . the sample taken from the milk collection point is not secured and prone to manipulation . the temperature of the milk transferred to milk tanker is not measured . the data of composite milk sample is also not taken into consideration . therefore , to overcome these challenges , prompt has uniquely developed tank ##ass ##ure , an intelligent and digital system which automatically samples milk from milk collection point . presenting an automatic milk sampling system , with gps , wi - fi and rf ##id technology tank ##ass ##ure is an electro - mechanical , intelligent box mounted behind the milk tanker . it is a closed , container ##ised and digitally password - protected secured system that consists of sampling pumps , and rf ##id - tagged tam ##per - proof sample vial ##s . it automatically collects the milk sample of milk collection point , measures the milk quantity and temperature with the help of an in - built magnetic ﬂ ##ow meter equipped with a temperature sensor . key highlights of the system enables secured and automatic sampling of composite milk samples of various milk collection points . the entire operation is controlled by a web - based portal accessed through a tablet device . the milk quantity and temperature data of each milk collection point is transferred to a central portal which can be used by the dairy for further business analysis . it can be integrated with any route management app and automatic milk collection system . the system can log the location and time stamp data from where milk transfer starts and stop . only authorised personnel can open the electronically protected door at the dairy . tank ##ass ##ure - technical specifications model s ##7 s ##15 6 for society samples 1 for composite sample 14 for society samples 1 for composite sample no . of sampling bottles 7 no . 15 no . per ##ista ##lt ##ic pumps sampling capacity 40 ml 40 ml plc , electro magnetic flow meter , gps , rf ##id tag & reader , per ##ista ##lt ##ic pumps major technical parts wi - fi , 4 ##g data transmission 8 " 4 ##g + wi - fi tablet user interface central web - based application central data controlling gps , g ##lon ##ass or galileo , 24 ##vd ##c , ethernet , ip ##6 ##8 , internal antenna , temperature range - 40 °c to + 70 °c gps electromagnetic flow ##meter measure : flow , temperature and quantity output : 4 - 20 ##ma , pulse accuracy max . ± ##0 . 5 % o . f . s . flow meter 13 . 56 ##m ##h ##z , led indication , io - link interface , m1 ##2 connection , ip ##6 ##7 rf [SEP]
